Examples in the book are generated under version 2.5.1. You can get a stable Bioconductor version from http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/ComplexHeatmap.html, but the most up-to-date version is always on Github and you can install it by: library(devtools) install_github(&quot;jokergoo/ComplexHeatmap&quot;) The development branch on Bioconductor is basically synchronized to Github repository. The ComplexHeatmap package is inspired from the pheatmap package. You can find many arguments in ComplexHeatmap have the same names as in pheatmap. Also you can find this old package that I tried to develop by modifying pheatmap. Please note, this documentation is not completely compatible with older versions (&lt; 1.99.0, before Oct, 2018), but the major functionality keeps the same. If you use ComplexHeatmap in your publications, I am appreciated if you can cite: Gu, Z. (2016) Complex heatmaps reveal patterns and correlations in multidimensional genomic data.

["introduction.html", "Chapter 1 Introduction 1.1 General design 1.2 A brief description of following chapters", " Chapter 1 Introduction Complex heatmaps are efficient to visualize associations between different sources of data sets and reveal potential patterns. Here the ComplexHeatmap package provides a highly flexible way to arrange multiple heatmaps and supports self-defined annotation graphics. 1.1 General design A single heatmap is composed of the heatmap body and the heatmap components. The heatmap body can be split by rows and columns. The heatmap components are titles, dendrograms, matrix names and heatmap annotations, which are put on the four sides of the heamap body. The heatmap components are reordered or split according to the heatmap body. A heatmap list is concatenation of a list of heatmaps and heatmap annotations. Surrounding the heatmap list, there are global-level titles and legends. One important things for the heatmap list is that rows for all heatmaps and annotations (it is row annotation if the heatmap list is horizontal.) are all adusted so that the same row in all heatmaps and annotations corresponds to a same feature. The heatmaps and annotations (now it is column annotation) can also be arranged vertically. And the heatmap list can also be split by rows and by columns. The ComplexHeatmap package is implemented in an object-oriented way. To describe a heatmap list, there are following classes: Heatmap class: a single heatmap containing heatmap body, row/column names, titles, dendrograms and row/column annotations. HeatmapList class: a list of heatmaps and heatmap annotations. HeatmapAnnotation class: defines a list of row annotations and column annotations. The heatmap annotations can be components of heatmap, also they can be independent as heatmaps. There are also several internal classes: SingleAnnotation class: defines a single row annotation or column annotation. The HeatmapAnnotation object contains a list of SingleAnnotation objects. ColorMapping class: mapping from values to colors. The color mappings of the main matrix and the annotations are controlled by ColorMapping class. AnnotationFunction class: constructs user-defined annotations. This is the base of creating user-defined annotation graphics. ComplexHeatmap is implemented under grid system, so users need to know basic grid functionality to get full use of the package. 1.2 A brief description of following chapters A Single Heatmap This chapter describes the configurations of a single heatmap. Heatmap Annotations This chapter describes the concept of the heatmap annotation and demonstrates how to make simple annotations as well as complex annotations. Also, the chapter explains the difference between column annotations and row annotations. A List of Heatmaps This chapter describes how to concatenate a list of heatmaps and annotations and how adjustment is applied to keep the correspondence of the heatmaps. Legends This chapter describes how to configurate the heatmap legends and annotation legends, also how to create self-defined legends. Heatmap Decoration This chapter describes methods to add more self-defined graphics to the heatmaps after the heatmaps are generated. OncoPrint This chapter describes how to make oncoPrints and how to integrate other functionalities from ComplexHeatmap to oncoPrints. UpSet plot This chapter describes how to make enhanced UpSet plots. Other High-level Plots This chapter describes functions implemented in ComplexHeatmap for specific use, e.g. visualizing distributions.

Although “the shining point” of the ComplexHeatmap package is it can visualize a list of heatmaps in parallel, as the basic unit of the heatmap list, it is still very important to have the single heatmap nicely configured. First let’s generate a random matrix where there are three groups by columns and three groups by rows: set.seed(123) nr1 = 4; nr2 = 8; nr3 = 6; nr = nr1 + nr2 + nr3 nc1 = 6; nc2 = 8; nc3 = 10; nc = nc1 + nc2 + nc3 mat = cbind(rbind(matrix(rnorm(nr1*nc1, mean = 1, sd = 0.5), nr = nr1), matrix(rnorm(nr2*nc1, mean = 0, sd = 0.5), nr = nr2), matrix(rnorm(nr3*nc1, mean = 0, sd = 0.5), nr = nr3)), rbind(matrix(rnorm(nr1*nc2, mean = 0, sd = 0.5), nr = nr1), matrix(rnorm(nr2*nc2, mean = 1, sd = 0.5), nr = nr2), matrix(rnorm(nr3*nc2, mean = 0, sd = 0.5), nr = nr3)), rbind(matrix(rnorm(nr1*nc3, mean = 0.5, sd = 0.5), nr = nr1), matrix(rnorm(nr2*nc3, mean = 0.5, sd = 0.5), nr = nr2), matrix(rnorm(nr3*nc3, mean = 1, sd = 0.5), nr = nr3)) ) mat = mat[sample(nr, nr), sample(nc, nc)] # random shuffle rows and columns rownames(mat) = paste0(&quot;row&quot;, seq_len(nr)) colnames(mat) = paste0(&quot;column&quot;, seq_len(nc)) Following command contains the minimal argument for the Heatmap() function which just visualizes the matrix as a heatmap with default settings. Very similar as other heatmap tools, it draws the dendrograms, the row/column names and the heatmap legend. The default color schema is “blue-white-red” which is mapped to the minimal-mean-maximal values in the matrix. The title for the legend is assigned with an internal index number. Heatmap(mat) The title for the legend is taken from the “name” of the heatmap by default. Each heatmap has a name which is like a unique identifier for the heatmap and it is important when you have a list of heatmaps. In later chapters, you will find the heatmap name is used for setting the “main heatmap” and is used for decoration of heatmaps. If the name is not assigned, an internal name is assigned to the heatmap in a form of matrix_%d. In following examples in this chapter, we give the name mat to the heatmap (for which you will see the change of the legend in the next plot). If you put Heatmap() inside a function or a for/if/while chunk, you won’t see the heatmap after executing Heatmap(). In this case, you need to use draw() function explicitly as follows. We will explain this point in more detail in Section 2.11. ht = Heatmap(mat) draw(ht) 2.1 Colors For heatmap visualization, colors are the major representation of the data matrix. In most cases, the heatmap visualizes a matrix with continuous numeric values. In this case, users should provide a color mapping function. A color mapping function should accept a vector of values and return a vector of corresponding colors. Users should always use circlize::colorRamp2() function to generate the color mapping function with using Heatmap(). The two arguments for colorRamp2() is a vector of break values and a vector of corresponding colors. colorRamp2() linearly interpolates colors in every interval through LAB color space. Also using colorRamp2() helps to generate a legend with proper tick marks. In following example, values between -2 and 2 are linearly interpolated to get corresponding colors, values larger than 2 are all mapped to red and values less than -2 are all mapped to green. library(circlize) col_fun = colorRamp2(c(-2, 0, 2), c(&quot;green&quot;, &quot;white&quot;, &quot;red&quot;)) col_fun(seq(-3, 3)) ## [1] &quot;#00FF00FF&quot; &quot;#00FF00FF&quot; &quot;#B1FF9AFF&quot; &quot;#FFFFFFFF&quot; &quot;#FF9E81FF&quot; &quot;#FF0000FF&quot; ## [7] &quot;#FF0000FF&quot; Heatmap(mat, name = &quot;mat&quot;, col = col_fun) As you can see, the color mapping function exactly maps negative values to green and positive values to red, even when the distribution of negative values and positive values are not centric to zero. Also this color mapping function is not affected by outliers. In following plot, the clustering is heavily affected by the outlier but not the color mapping. mat2 = mat mat2[1, 1] = 100000 Heatmap(mat2, name = &quot;mat&quot;, col = col_fun) More importantly, colorRamp2() makes colors in multiple heatmaps comparible if they are set with a same color mapping function. In following three heatmaps, a same color always corresponds to a same value. Heatmap(mat, name = &quot;mat&quot;, col = col_fun, column_title = &quot;mat&quot;) Heatmap(mat/4, name = &quot;mat&quot;, col = col_fun, column_title = &quot;mat/4&quot;) Heatmap(abs(mat), name = &quot;mat&quot;, col = col_fun, column_title = &quot;abs(mat)&quot;) If the matrix is continuous, you can also simply provide a vector of colors and colors will be linearly interpolated. But remember this method is not robust to outliers because the mapping starts from the minimal value in the matrix and ends with the maximal value. Following color mapping setting is identical to colorRamp2(seq(min(mat), max(mat), length = 10), rev(rainbow(10))). Heatmap(mat, name = &quot;mat&quot;, col = rev(rainbow(10))) If the matrix contains discrete values (either numeric or character), colors should be specified as a named vector to make it possible for the mapping from discrete values to colors. If there is no name for the color, the order of colors corresponds to the order of unique(mat). Note now the legend is generated from the color mapping vector. Following sets colors for a discrete numeric matrix (you don’t need to convert it to a character matrix). discrete_mat = matrix(sample(1:4, 100, replace = TRUE), 10, 10) colors = structure(1:4, names = c(&quot;1&quot;, &quot;2&quot;, &quot;3&quot;, &quot;4&quot;)) # black, red, green, blue Heatmap(discrete_mat, name = &quot;mat&quot;, col = colors) Or a character matrix: discrete_mat = matrix(sample(letters[1:4], 100, replace = TRUE), 10, 10) colors = structure(1:4, names = letters[1:4]) Heatmap(discrete_mat, name = &quot;mat&quot;, col = colors) As you see in the two examples above, for the numeric matrix (no matter the color is continuous mapping or discrete mapping), by default clustering is applied on both dimensions while for character matrix, clustering is turned off (but you can still cluster a character matrix if you provide a proper distance metric for two character vectors, see example in Section 2.3.1). NA is allowed in the matrix. You can control the color of NA by na_col argument (by default it is grey for NA). The matrix that contains NA can be clustered by Heatmap(). Note the NA value is not presented in the legend. mat_with_na = mat na_index = sample(c(TRUE, FALSE), nrow(mat)*ncol(mat), replace = TRUE, prob = c(1, 9)) mat_with_na[na_index] = NA Heatmap(mat_with_na, name = &quot;mat&quot;, na_col = &quot;black&quot;) Color space is important for interpolating colors. By default, colors are linearly interpolated in LAB color space, but you can select the color space in colorRamp2() function. Compare following two plots. Can you see the difference? f1 = colorRamp2(seq(min(mat), max(mat), length = 3), c(&quot;blue&quot;, &quot;#EEEEEE&quot;, &quot;red&quot;)) f2 = colorRamp2(seq(min(mat), max(mat), length = 3), c(&quot;blue&quot;, &quot;#EEEEEE&quot;, &quot;red&quot;), space = &quot;RGB&quot;) Heatmap(mat, name = &quot;mat1&quot;, col = f1, column_title = &quot;LAB color space&quot;) Heatmap(mat, name = &quot;mat2&quot;, col = f2, column_title = &quot;RGB color space&quot;) In following plots, corresponding values change evenly on the folded lines, you can see how colors change under different color spaces (top plots: green-black-red, bottom plots: blue-white-red. The plot is made by HilbertCurvepackage). Last but not the least, colors for the heatmap borders can be set by the border and rect_gp arguments. border controls the global border of the heatmap body and rect_gp controls the border of the grids in the heatmap. The value of border can be logical (TRUE corresponds to black) or a character of color (e.g. red). rect_gp is a gpar object which means you can only set it by grid::gpar(). Since the filled color is already controlled by the heatmap color mapping, you can only set the col parameter in gpar() to control the border of the heatmap grids. Heatmap(mat, name = &quot;mat&quot;, border = TRUE) Heatmap(mat, name = &quot;mat&quot;, rect_gp = gpar(col = &quot;white&quot;, lwd = 2)) If col is not set, the default color mapping by Heatmap() is designed with trying to be as convinient and meaningful as possible. Following are the rules for the default color mapping (by ComplexHeatmap:::default_col()): If the values are characters, the colors are generated by circlize::rand_color(); If the values are from the heatmap annotation and are numeric, colors are mapped between white and one random color by linearly interpolating to the mininum and maxinum. If the values are from the matrix (let’s denote it as \\(M\\)) which corresponds to the heatmap body: If the fraction of positive values in \\(M\\) is between 25% and 75%, colors are mapped to blue, white and red by linearly interpolating to \\(-q\\), 0 and \\(q\\), where \\(q\\) is the maximum of \\(|M|\\) if the number of unique values is less than 100, or \\(q\\) is the 99^th percentile of \\(|M|\\). This color mapping is centric to zero. Or else the colors are mapped to blue, white and red by linearly interpolating to \\(q_1\\), \\((q_1 + q_2)/2\\) and \\(q_2\\), where \\(q_1\\) and \\(q_2\\) are mininum and maxinum if the number of unique values is \\(M\\) is less than 100, or \\(q1\\) is the 1^th percentile and \\(q2\\) is the 99^th percentile in \\(M\\). rect_gp allows a non-standard parameter type. If it is set to \"none\", the clustering is still applied but nothing in drawn on the heatmap body. The customized graphics on heatmap body can be added via a self-defined cell_fun or layer_fun (see Section 2.9). Heatmap(mat, name = &quot;mat&quot;, rect_gp = gpar(type = &quot;none&quot;)) 2.2 Titles The title of the heatmap basically tells what the plot is about. In ComplexHeatmap package, you can set heatmap title either by the row or/and by the column. Note at a same time you can only put e.g. column title either on the top or at the bottom of the heatmap. The graphic parameters can be set by row_title_gp and column_title_gp respectively. Please remember you should use gpar() to specify graphic parameters. Heatmap(mat, name = &quot;mat&quot;, column_title = &quot;I am a column title&quot;, row_title = &quot;I am a row title&quot;) Heatmap(mat, name = &quot;mat&quot;, column_title = &quot;I am a column title at the bottom&quot;, column_title_side = &quot;bottom&quot;) Heatmap(mat, name = &quot;mat&quot;, column_title = &quot;I am a big column title&quot;, column_title_gp = gpar(fontsize = 20, fontface = &quot;bold&quot;)) Rotations for titles can be set by row_title_rot and column_title_rot, but only horizontal and vertical rotations are allowed. Heatmap(mat, name = &quot;mat&quot;, row_title = &quot;row title&quot;, row_title_rot = 0) Row or column title supports as a template which is used when rows or columns are split in the heatmap (because there will be multiple row/column titles). This functionality is introduced in Section 2.7. A quick example would be: # code only for demonstration # row title would be cluster_1 and cluster_2 Heatmap(mat, name = &quot;mat&quot;, row_km = 2, row_title = &quot;cluster_%s&quot;) You can set fill parameter in row_title_gp and column_title_gp to set the background color of titles. Since col in e.g. row_title_gp controls the color of text, border is used to control the color of the background border. Heatmap(mat, name = &quot;mat&quot;, column_title = &quot;I am a column title&quot;, column_title_gp = gpar(fill = &quot;red&quot;, col = &quot;white&quot;, border = &quot;red&quot;)) If the graphic elements are texts, they can be set as mathematical formulas. Heatmap(mat, name = &quot;mat&quot;, column_title = expression(hat(beta) == (X^t * X)^{-1} * X^t * y)) 2.3 Clustering Clustering might be the key component of the heatmap visualization. In ComplexHeatmap package, hierarchical clustering is supported with great flexibility. You can specify the clustering either by: a pre-defined distance method (e.g. \"euclidean\" or \"pearson\"), a distance function, a object that already contains clustering (a hclust or dendrogram object or object that can be coerced to dendrogram class), a clustering function. It is also possible to render the dendrograms with different colors and styles for different branches for better revealing structures of the dendrogram (e.g. by dendextend::color_branches()). First, there are general settings for the clustering, e.g. whether apply clustering or show dendrograms, the side of the dendrograms and heights of the dendrograms. Heatmap(mat, name = &quot;mat&quot;, cluster_rows = FALSE) # turn off row clustering Heatmap(mat, name = &quot;mat&quot;, show_column_dend = FALSE) # hide column dendrogram Heatmap(mat, name = &quot;mat&quot;, row_dend_side = &quot;right&quot;, column_dend_side = &quot;bottom&quot;) Heatmap(mat, name = &quot;mat&quot;, column_dend_height = unit(4, &quot;cm&quot;), row_dend_width = unit(4, &quot;cm&quot;)) 2.3.1 Distance methods Hierarchical clustering is performed in two steps: calculate the distance matrix and apply clustering. There are three ways to specify distance metric for clustering: specify distance as a pre-defined option. The valid values are the supported methods in dist() function and in \"pearson\", \"spearman\" and \"kendall\". The correlation distance is defined as 1 - cor(x, y, method). All these built-in distance methods allow NA values. a self-defined function which calculates distance from a matrix. The function should only contain one argument. Please note for clustering on columns, the matrix will be transposed automatically. a self-defined function which calculates distance from two vectors. The function should only contain two arguments. Note this might be slow because it is implemented by two nested for loop. Heatmap(mat, name = &quot;mat&quot;, clustering_distance_rows = &quot;pearson&quot;, column_title = &quot;pre-defined distance method (1 - pearson)&quot;) Heatmap(mat, name = &quot;mat&quot;, clustering_distance_rows = function(m) dist(m), column_title = &quot;a function that calculates distance matrix&quot;) Heatmap(mat, name = &quot;mat&quot;, clustering_distance_rows = function(x, y) 1 - cor(x, y), column_title = &quot;a function that calculates pairwise distance&quot;) Based on these features, we can apply clustering which is robust to outliers based on the pairwise distance. Note here we set the color mapping function because we don’t want outliers affect the colors. mat_with_outliers = mat for(i in 1:10) mat_with_outliers[i, i] = 1000 robust_dist = function(x, y) { qx = quantile(x, c(0.1, 0.9)) qy = quantile(y, c(0.1, 0.9)) l = x &gt; qx[1] &amp; x &lt; qx[2] &amp; y &gt; qy[1] &amp; y &lt; qy[2] x = x[l] y = y[l] sqrt(sum((x - y)^2)) } We can compare the two heatmaps with or without the robust distance method: Heatmap(mat_with_outliers, name = &quot;mat&quot;, col = colorRamp2(c(-2, 0, 2), c(&quot;green&quot;, &quot;white&quot;, &quot;red&quot;)), column_title = &quot;dist&quot;) Heatmap(mat_with_outliers, name = &quot;mat&quot;, col = colorRamp2(c(-2, 0, 2), c(&quot;green&quot;, &quot;white&quot;, &quot;red&quot;)), clustering_distance_rows = robust_dist, clustering_distance_columns = robust_dist, column_title = &quot;robust_dist&quot;) If there are proper distance methods (like methods in stringdist package), you can also cluster a character matrix. cell_fun argument will be introduced in Section 2.9. mat_letters = matrix(sample(letters[1:4], 100, replace = TRUE), 10) # distance in the ASCII table dist_letters = function(x, y) { x = strtoi(charToRaw(paste(x, collapse = &quot;&quot;)), base = 16) y = strtoi(charToRaw(paste(y, collapse = &quot;&quot;)), base = 16) sqrt(sum((x - y)^2)) } Heatmap(mat_letters, name = &quot;letters&quot;, col = structure(2:5, names = letters[1:4]), clustering_distance_rows = dist_letters, clustering_distance_columns = dist_letters, cell_fun = function(j, i, x, y, w, h, col) { # add text to each grid grid.text(mat_letters[i, j], x, y) }) 2.3.2 Clustering methods Method to perform hierarchical clustering can be specified by clustering_method_rows and clustering_method_columns. Possible methods are those supported in hclust() function. Heatmap(mat, name = &quot;mat&quot;, clustering_method_rows = &quot;single&quot;) If you already have a clustering object or a function which directly returns a clustering object, you can ignore the distance settings and set cluster_rows or cluster_columns to the clustering objects or clustering functions. If it is a clustering function, the only argument should be the matrix and it should return a hclust or dendrogram object or a object that can be coerced to the dendrogram class. In following example, we perform clustering with methods from cluster package either by a pre-calculated clustering object or a clustering function: library(cluster) Heatmap(mat, name = &quot;mat&quot;, cluster_rows = diana(mat), cluster_columns = agnes(t(mat)), column_title = &quot;clustering objects&quot;) # if cluster_columns is set as a function, you don&#39;t need to transpose the matrix Heatmap(mat, name = &quot;mat&quot;, cluster_rows = diana, cluster_columns = agnes, column_title = &quot;clustering functions&quot;) The last command is as same as : # code only for demonstration Heatmap(mat, name = &quot;mat&quot;, cluster_rows = function(m) as.dendrogram(diana(m)), cluster_columns = function(m) as.dendrogram(agnes(m)), column_title = &quot;clutering functions&quot;) Please note, when cluster_rows is set as a function, the argument m is the input mat itself, while for cluster_columns, m is the transpose of mat. fastcluster::hclust implements a faster version of hclust(). You can set it to cluster_rows and cluster_columns to use the faster version of hclust(). # code only for demonstration fh = function(x) fastcluster::hclust(dist(x)) Heatmap(mat, name = &quot;mat&quot;, cluster_rows = fh, cluster_columns = fh) To make it more convinient to use the faster version of hclust() (assuming you have many heatmaps to construct), it can be set as a global option. The usage of ht_opt is introduced in Section 4.13. # code only for demonstration ht_opt$fast_hclust = TRUE # now fastcluster::hclust is used in all heatmaps This is one specific scenario that you might already have a subgroup classification for the matrix rows or columns, and you only want to perform clustering for the features in the same subgroup. There is one way that you can split the heatmap by the subgroup variable (see Section 2.7), or you can use cluster_within_group() clustering function to generate a special dendrogram. group = kmeans(t(mat), centers = 3)$cluster Heatmap(mat, name = &quot;mat&quot;, cluster_columns = cluster_within_group(mat, group)) In above example, columns in a same group are still clustered, but the dendrogram is degenerated as a flat line. The dendrogram on columns shows the hierarchy of the groups. 2.3.3 Render dendrograms If you want to render the dendrogram, normally you need to generate a dendrogram object and render it in the first place, then send it to the cluster_rows or cluster_columns argument. You can render your dendrogram object by the dendextend package to make a more customized visualization of the dendrogram. Note ComplexHeatmap only allows rendering on the dendrogram lines. library(dendextend) row_dend = as.dendrogram(hclust(dist(mat))) row_dend = color_branches(row_dend, k = 2) # `color_branches()` returns a dendrogram object Heatmap(mat, name = &quot;mat&quot;, cluster_rows = row_dend) row_dend_gp and column_dend_gp control the global graphic setting for dendrograms. Note e.g. graphic settings in row_dend will be overwritten by row_dend_gp. Heatmap(mat, name = &quot;mat&quot;, cluster_rows = row_dend, row_dend_gp = gpar(col = &quot;red&quot;)) 2.3.4 Reorder dendrograms In the Heatmap() function, dendrograms are reordered to make features with larger difference more separated from each others (please refer to the documentation of reorder.dendrogram()). Here the difference (or it is called the weight) is measured by the row means if it is a row dendrogram or by the column means if it is a column dendrogram. row_dend_reorder and column_dend_reorder control whether to apply dendrogram reordering if the value is set as logical. The two arguments also control the weight for the reordering if they are set to numeric vectors (it will be sent to the wts argument of reorder.dendrogram()). The reordering can be turned off by setting e.g. row_dend_reorder = FALSE. By default, dendrogram reordering is turned on if cluster_rows/cluster_columns is set as logical value or a clustering function. It is turned off if cluster_rows/cluster_columns is set as clustering object. Compare following two heatmaps: m2 = matrix(1:100, nr = 10, byrow = TRUE) Heatmap(m2, name = &quot;mat&quot;, row_dend_reorder = FALSE, column_title = &quot;no reordering&quot;) Heatmap(m2, name = &quot;mat&quot;, row_dend_reorder = TRUE, column_title = &quot;apply reordering&quot;) There are many other methods for reordering dendrograms, e.g. the dendsort package. Basically, all these methods still return a dendrogram that has been reordered, thus, we can firstly generate the row or column dendrogram based on the data matrix, reorder it by some method, and assign it back to cluster_rows or cluster_columns. Compare following two reorderings. Can you tell which is better? Heatmap(mat, name = &quot;mat&quot;, column_title = &quot;default reordering&quot;) library(dendsort) dend = dendsort(hclust(dist(mat))) Heatmap(mat, name = &quot;mat&quot;, cluster_rows = dend, column_title = &quot;reorder by dendsort&quot;) 2.4 Set row and column orders Clustering is used to adjust row orders and column orders of the heatmap, but you can still set the order manually by row_order and column_order. If e.g. row_order is set, row clustering is turned off by default. Heatmap(mat, name = &quot;mat&quot;, row_order = order(as.numeric(gsub(&quot;row&quot;, &quot;&quot;, rownames(mat)))), column_order = order(as.numeric(gsub(&quot;column&quot;, &quot;&quot;, colnames(mat))))) The orders can be character vectors if they are just shuffles of the matrix row names or column names. Heatmap(mat, name = &quot;mat&quot;, row_order = sort(rownames(mat)), column_order = sort(colnames(mat))) Note row_dend_reorder and row_order are two different things. row_dend_reorder is applied on the dendrogram. For any node in the dendrogram, rotating its two branches actually gives an identical dendrogram, thus, reordering the dendrogram by automatically rotating sub-dendrogram at every node can help to separate elements further from each other which show more difference. As a comparison, row_order is simply applied on the matrix and normally dendrograms should be turned off. 2.5 Seriation Seriation is an interesting technique for ordering the matrix (see this interesting post: http://nicolas.kruchten.com/content/2018/02/seriation/). The powerful seriation package implements quite a lot of methods for seriation. Since it is easy to extract row orders and column orders from the object returned by the core function seriate() from seriation package. They can be directly assigned to row_order and column_order to make the heatmap. The first example demonstrates to directly apply seriate() on the matrix. Since the \"BEA_TSP\" method only allows a non-negative matrix, we modify the matrix to max(mat) - mat. library(seriation) o = seriate(max(mat) - mat, method = &quot;BEA_TSP&quot;) Heatmap(max(mat) - mat, name = &quot;mat&quot;, row_order = get_order(o, 1), column_order = get_order(o, 2)) Or you can apply seriate() to the distance matrix. Now the order for rows and columns needs to be calcualted separatedly because the distance matrix needs to be calculated separatedly for columns and rows. o1 = seriate(dist(mat), method = &quot;TSP&quot;) o2 = seriate(dist(t(mat)), method = &quot;TSP&quot;) Heatmap(mat, name = &quot;mat&quot;, row_order = get_order(o1), column_order = get_order(o2)) Some seriation methods also contain the hierarchical clustering information. Let’s try: o1 = seriate(dist(mat), method = &quot;GW&quot;) o2 = seriate(dist(t(mat)), method = &quot;GW&quot;) o1 and o2 are actually mainly composed of hclust objects: class(o1[[1]]) ## [1] &quot;ser_permutation_vector&quot; &quot;hclust&quot; And the orders are the same by using hclust$order or get_order(). o1[[1]]$order ## [1] 5 2 10 17 4 16 18 7 15 14 11 8 1 3 12 6 13 9 # should be the same as the previous one get_order(o1) ## [1] 5 2 10 17 4 16 18 7 15 14 11 8 1 3 12 6 13 9 And we can add the dendrograms to the heatmap. Heatmap(mat, name = &quot;mat&quot;, cluster_rows = as.dendrogram(o1[[1]]), cluster_columns = as.dendrogram(o2[[1]])) For more use of the seriate() function, please refer to the seriation package. 2.6 Dimension names The row names and column names are drawn on the right and bottom sides of the heatmap by default. Side, visibility and graphic parameters for dimension names can be set as follows: Heatmap(mat, name = &quot;mat&quot;, row_names_side = &quot;left&quot;, row_dend_side = &quot;right&quot;, column_names_side = &quot;top&quot;, column_dend_side = &quot;bottom&quot;) Heatmap(mat, name = &quot;mat&quot;, show_row_names = FALSE) Heatmap(mat, name = &quot;mat&quot;, row_names_gp = gpar(fontsize = 20)) Heatmap(mat, name = &quot;mat&quot;, row_names_gp = gpar(col = c(rep(&quot;red&quot;, 10), rep(&quot;blue&quot;, 8)))) Heatmap(mat, name = &quot;mat&quot;, row_names_centered = TRUE, column_names_centered = TRUE) The rotation of column names can be set by column_names_rot: Heatmap(mat, name = &quot;mat&quot;, column_names_rot = 45) Heatmap(mat, name = &quot;mat&quot;, column_names_rot = 45, column_names_side = &quot;top&quot;, column_dend_side = &quot;bottom&quot;) If you have row names or column names which are too long, row_names_max_width or column_names_max_height can be used to set the maximal space for them. The default maximal space for row names and column names are all 6 cm. In following code, max_text_width() is a helper function to quick calculate maximal width from a vector of text. mat2 = mat rownames(mat2)[1] = paste(c(letters, LETTERS), collapse = &quot;&quot;) Heatmap(mat2, name = &quot;mat&quot;) Heatmap(mat2, name = &quot;mat&quot;, row_names_max_width = max_text_width( rownames(mat2), gp = gpar(fontsize = 12) )) Instead of directly using the row/column names from the matrix, you can also provide another character vector which corresponds to the rows or columns and set it by row_labels or column_labels. This is useful because you don’t need to change the dimension names of the matrix to change the labels on the heatmap while you can directly provide the new labels. There is one typical scenario that row_labels and column_labels are useful. For the gene expression analysis, we might use Ensembl ID as the gene ID which is used as row names of the gene expression matrix. However, the Ensembl ID is for the indexing of the Ensembl database but not for the human reading. Instead, we would prefer to put gene symbols on the heatmap as the row names which is easier to read. To do this, we only need to assign the corresponding gene symbols to row_labels without modifying the original matrix. The second advantage is row_labels or column_labels allows duplicated labels, while duplicated row names or column names are not allowed in the matrix. Following gives a simple example that we put letters as row labels and column labels: # use a named vector to make sure the correspondance between # row names and row labels is correct row_labels = structure(paste0(letters[1:24], 1:24), names = paste0(&quot;row&quot;, 1:24)) column_labels = structure(paste0(LETTERS[1:24], 1:24), names = paste0(&quot;column&quot;, 1:24)) row_labels ## row1 row2 row3 row4 row5 row6 row7 row8 row9 row10 row11 row12 row13 ## &quot;a1&quot; &quot;b2&quot; &quot;c3&quot; &quot;d4&quot; &quot;e5&quot; &quot;f6&quot; &quot;g7&quot; &quot;h8&quot; &quot;i9&quot; &quot;j10&quot; &quot;k11&quot; &quot;l12&quot; &quot;m13&quot; ## row14 row15 row16 row17 row18 row19 row20 row21 row22 row23 row24 ## &quot;n14&quot; &quot;o15&quot; &quot;p16&quot; &quot;q17&quot; &quot;r18&quot; &quot;s19&quot; &quot;t20&quot; &quot;u21&quot; &quot;v22&quot; &quot;w23&quot; &quot;x24&quot; Heatmap(mat, name = &quot;mat&quot;, row_labels = row_labels[rownames(mat)], column_labels = column_labels[colnames(mat)]) The third advantage is mathematical expression can be used as row names in the heatmap. Heatmap(mat, name = &quot;mat&quot;, row_labels = expression(alpha, beta, gamma, delta, epsilon, zeta, eta, theta, iota, kappa, lambda, mu, nu, xi, omicron, pi, rho, sigma)) anno_text() (Section 3.14) can be used to add more customized labels for heatmap rows and columns. 2.7 Heatmap split One major advantage of ComplexHeatmap package is it supports splitting the heatmap by rows and columns to better group the features and additionally highlight the patterns. Following arguments control the splitting: row_km, row_split, column_km, column_split. In following, we call the sub-clusters generated by splitting “slices”. 2.7.1 Split by k-means clustering row_km and column_km apply k-means partitioning. Heatmap(mat, name = &quot;mat&quot;, row_km = 2) Heatmap(mat, name = &quot;mat&quot;, column_km = 3) Row splitting and column splitting can be performed simultaneously. Heatmap(mat, name = &quot;mat&quot;, row_km = 2, column_km = 3) You might notice there are dashed lines in the row and column dendrograms, it will be explained in Section 2.7.2 (last paragraph). Heatmap() internally calls kmeans() with random start points, which results in, for some cases, generating different clusters from repeated runs. To get rid of this problem, row_km_repeats and column_km_repeats can be set to a number larger than 1 to run kmeans() multiple times and a final consensus k-means clustering is used. Please note the final number of clusters form consensus k-means might be smaller than the number set in row_km and column_km. Heatmap(mat, name = &quot;mat&quot;, row_km = 2, row_km_repeats = 100, column_km = 3, column_km_repeats = 100) 2.7.2 Split by categorical variables More generally, row_split or column_split can be set to a categorical vector or a data frame where different combinations of levels split the rows/columns in the heatmap. How to control the order of the slices is introduced in Section 2.7.4. # split by a vector Heatmap(mat, name = &quot;mat&quot;, row_split = rep(c(&quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;), 9), column_split = rep(c(&quot;C&quot;, &quot;D&quot;), 12)) # split by a data frame Heatmap(mat, name = &quot;mat&quot;, row_split = data.frame(rep(c(&quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;), 9), rep(c(&quot;C&quot;, &quot;D&quot;), each = 9))) # split on both dimensions Heatmap(mat, name = &quot;mat&quot;, row_split = factor(rep(c(&quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;), 9)), column_split = factor(rep(c(&quot;C&quot;, &quot;D&quot;), 12))) Actually, k-means clustering just generates a vector of cluster classes and appends to row_split or column_split. row_km/column_km and be used mixed with row_split and column_split. Heatmap(mat, name = &quot;mat&quot;, row_split = rep(c(&quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;), 9), row_km = 2) which is the same as: # code only for demonstration cl = kmeans(mat, centers = 2)$cluster # classes from k-means are always put as the first column in `row_split` Heatmap(mat, name = &quot;mat&quot;, row_split = cbind(cl, rep(c(&quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;), 9))) If you are not happy with the default k-means partition, it is easy to use other partition methods by just assigning the partition vector to row_split/column_split. pa = cluster::pam(mat, k = 3) Heatmap(mat, name = &quot;mat&quot;, row_split = paste0(&quot;pam&quot;, pa$clustering)) If row_order or column_order is set, in each row/column slice, it is still ordered. # remember when `row_order` is set, row clustering is turned off Heatmap(mat, name = &quot;mat&quot;, row_order = 18:1, row_km = 2) Character matrix can only be split by row_split/column_split argument. # split by the first column in `discrete_mat` Heatmap(discrete_mat, name = &quot;mat&quot;, col = 1:4, row_split = discrete_mat[, 1]) If row_km/column_km is set or row_split/column_split is set as a vector or a data frame, hierarchical clustering is first applied to each slice (of course, clustering should be turned on) which generates k dendrograms, then a parent dendrogram is generated based on the mean values of each slice. The height of the parent dendrogram is adjusted by adding the maximal height of the dendrograms in all children slices and the parent dendrogram is added on top of the children dendrograms to form a single global dendrogram. This is why you see dashed lines in the dendrograms in previous heatmaps. They are used to mark the parent dendrogram and the children dendrograms, and alert users they are calculated in different ways. These dashed lines can be removed by setting show_parent_dend_line = FALSE in Heatmap(), or set it as a global option: ht_opt$show_parent_dend_line = FALSE. Heatmap(mat, name = &quot;mat&quot;, row_km = 2, column_km = 3, show_parent_dend_line = FALSE) 2.7.3 Split by dendrogram A second scenario for splitting is that users may still want to keep the global dendrogram which is generated from the complete matrix while not split it in the first place. In this case, row_split/column_split can be set to a single number which will apply cutree() on the row/column dendrogram. This works when cluster_rows/cluster_columns is set to TRUE or is assigned with a hclust/dendrogram object. For this case, the dendrogram is still as same as the original one, expect the positions of dendrogram leaves are slightly adjusted by the gaps between slices. (There is no dashed lines, because here the dendrogram is calcualted as a complete one and there is no parent dendrogram or children dendrograms.) Heatmap(mat, name = &quot;mat&quot;, row_split = 2, column_split = 3) dend = hclust(dist(mat)) dend = color_branches(dend, k = 2) Heatmap(mat, name = &quot;mat&quot;, cluster_rows = dend, row_split = 2) If you want to combine splitting from cutree() and other categorical variables, you need to generate the classes from cutree() in the first place, append to e.g. row_split as a data frame and then send it to row_split argument. # code only for demonstration split = data.frame(cutree(hclust(dist(mat)), k = 2), rep(c(&quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;), 9)) Heatmap(mat, name = &quot;mat&quot;, row_split = split) 2.7.4 Order of slices When row_split/column_split is set as categorical variable (a vector or a data frame) or row_km/column_km is set, by default, there is an additional clustering applied to the mean of slices to show the hierarchy in the slice level. Under this scenario, you cannot precisely control the order of slices because it is controlled by the clustering of slices. Nevertheless, you can set cluster_row_slices or cluster_column_slices to FALSE to turn off the clustering on slices, and now you can precisely control the order of slices. When there is no slice clustering, the order of each slice can be controlled by levels of each variable in row_split/column_split (in this case, each variable should be a factor). If all variables are characters, the default order is unique(row_split) or unique(column_split). Compare following heatmaps: Heatmap(mat, name = &quot;mat&quot;, row_split = rep(LETTERS[1:3], 6), column_split = rep(letters[1:6], 4)) # clustering is similar as previous heatmap with branches in some nodes in the dendrogram flipped Heatmap(mat, name = &quot;mat&quot;, row_split = factor(rep(LETTERS[1:3], 6), levels = LETTERS[3:1]), column_split = factor(rep(letters[1:6], 4), levels = letters[6:1])) # now the order is exactly what we set Heatmap(mat, name = &quot;mat&quot;, row_split = factor(rep(LETTERS[1:3], 6), levels = LETTERS[3:1]), column_split = factor(rep(letters[1:6], 4), levels = letters[6:1]), cluster_row_slices = FALSE, cluster_column_slices = FALSE) 2.7.5 Titles for splitting When row_split/column_split is set as a single number, there is only one categorical variable, while when row_km/column_km is set and/or row_split/column_split is set as categorical variables, there will be multiple categorical variables. By default, the titles are in a form of \"level1,level2,...\" which corresponds to every combination of levels in all categorical variables. The titles for splitting can be controlled by “a title template”. ComplexHeatmap supports three types of templates. The first one is by sprintf() where the %s is replaced by the corresponding level. In following example, since all combinations of split are A,C, A,D, B,C and B,D, if row_title is set to %s|%s, the four row titles will be A|C, A|D, B|C, B|D. split = data.frame(rep(c(&quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;), 9), rep(c(&quot;C&quot;, &quot;D&quot;), each = 9)) Heatmap(mat, name = &quot;mat&quot;, row_split = split, row_title = &quot;%s|%s&quot;) For the sprintf() template, you can only put the levels which are A,B,C,D in the title, and C,D is always after A,B. However, when making the heatmap, you might want to put more meaningful text instead of the internal levels. Once you know how to correspond the text to the level, you can add it by following two template methods. In the following two template methods, special marks are used to mark the R code which is executable (it is called variable interpolation where the code is extracted and executed and the returned value in put back to the string). There are two types of template marks @{} and {}. The first one is from GetoptLong package which should already be installed when you install the ComplexHeatmap package and the second one is from glue package which you need to install first. There is an internal variable x you should use when you use the latter two templates. x is just a simple vector which contains current category levels (e.g. c(\"A\", \"C\")). # We only run the code for the first heatmap map = c(&quot;A&quot; = &quot;aaa&quot;, &quot;B&quot; = &quot;bbb&quot;, &quot;C&quot; = &quot;333&quot;, &quot;D&quot; = &quot;444&quot;) Heatmap(mat, name = &quot;mat&quot;, row_split = split, row_title = &quot;@{map[ x[1] ]}|@{map[ x[2] ]}&quot;) Heatmap(mat, name = &quot;mat&quot;, row_split = split, row_title = &quot;{map[ x[1] ]}|{map[ x[2] ]}&quot;) The row title is rotated by default, you can set row_title_rot = 0 to make it horizontal: Heatmap(mat, name = &quot;mat&quot;, row_split = split, row_title = &quot;%s|%s&quot;, row_title_rot = 0) When row_split/column_split is set as a number, you can also use template to adjust the titles for slices. Heatmap(mat, name = &quot;mat&quot;, row_split = 2, row_title = &quot;cluster_%s&quot;) If you know the final number of row slices, you can directly set a vector of titles to row_title. Be careful the number of row slices is not always identical to nlevel_1*nlevel_2*.... Heatmap(mat, name = &quot;mat&quot;, row_split = split, row_title = c(&quot;top_slice&quot;, &quot;middle_top_slice&quot;, &quot;middle_bottom_slice&quot;, &quot;bottom_slice&quot;), row_title_rot = 0) If the length of row_title is specified as a single string, it will be like a single title for all slices. Heatmap(mat, name = &quot;mat&quot;, row_split = split, row_title = &quot;there are four slices&quot;) If you still want titles for each slice, but also a global title, you can do as follows. ht = Heatmap(mat, name = &quot;mat&quot;, row_split = split, row_title = &quot;%s|%s&quot;) draw(ht, row_title = &quot;I am a row title&quot;) Actually the row_title used in draw() function is the row title of the heatmap list, although in the example there is only one heatmap. The draw() function and the heatmap list will be introduced in Chapter 4. If row_title is set to NULL, no row title will be drawn. Heatmap(mat, name = &quot;mat&quot;, row_split = split, row_title = NULL) All these rules also work for column titles for slices. 2.7.6 Graphic parameters for splitting When splitting is applied on rows/columns, graphic parameters for row/column title and row/column names can be specified as same length as number of slices. Heatmap(mat, name = &quot;mat&quot;, row_km = 2, row_title_gp = gpar(col = c(&quot;red&quot;, &quot;blue&quot;), font = 1:2), row_names_gp = gpar(col = c(&quot;green&quot;, &quot;orange&quot;), fontsize = c(10, 14)), column_km = 3, column_title_gp = gpar(fill = c(&quot;red&quot;, &quot;blue&quot;, &quot;green&quot;), font = 1:3), column_names_gp = gpar(col = c(&quot;green&quot;, &quot;orange&quot;, &quot;purple&quot;), fontsize = c(10, 14, 8))) 2.7.7 Gaps between slices The space of gaps between row/column slices can be controlled by row_gap/column_gap. The value can be a single unit or a vector of units. Heatmap(mat, name = &quot;mat&quot;, row_km = 3, row_gap = unit(5, &quot;mm&quot;)) Heatmap(mat, name = &quot;mat&quot;, row_km = 3, row_gap = unit(c(2, 4), &quot;mm&quot;)) Heatmap(mat, name = &quot;mat&quot;, row_km = 3, row_gap = unit(c(2, 4), &quot;mm&quot;), column_km = 3, column_gap = unit(c(2, 4), &quot;mm&quot;)) When heatmap border is added by setting border = TRUE, the border of every slice is added. Heatmap(mat, name = &quot;mat&quot;, row_km = 2, column_km = 3, border = TRUE) If you set gap size to zero, the heatmap will look like it is partitioned by vertical and horizontal lines. Heatmap(mat, name = &quot;mat&quot;, row_km = 2, column_km = 3, row_gap = unit(0, &quot;mm&quot;), column_gap = unit(0, &quot;mm&quot;), border = TRUE) 2.7.8 Split heatmap annotations When the heatmap is split, all the heatmap components are split accordingly. Following gives you a simple example and the heatmap annotation will be introduced in Chapter 3. Heatmap(mat, name = &quot;mat&quot;, row_km = 2, column_km = 3, top_annotation = HeatmapAnnotation(foo1 = 1:24, bar1 = anno_points(runif(24))), right_annotation = rowAnnotation(foo2 = 18:1, bar2 = anno_barplot(runif(18))) ) 2.8 Heatmap as raster image Saving plots in PDF format is kind like best parctice to preserve the quality of the plots. However, when there are too many rows (say, &gt; 10000), the output PDF file would be huge and it takes long time and memory to read the whole plot. On the other hand, details of the huge matrix will not be seen in limited size of PDF file. Rendering heatmaps (the heatmap body) as raster images will effectively reduce the file size while the plot looks exactly the same for your screen or if you print it out. In Heatmap() function, there are four options which control how to generate the raster image: use_raster, raster_device, raster_quality, raster_device_param. You can choose graphic device (png, jpeg and tiff) by raster_device, control the quality of the raster image by raster_quality, and pass further parameters for a specific device by raster_device_param. If raster_quality is set to 1, internally, a PNG (if raster_device is set to png) file is generated with the same physical size as the heatmap body and refit into the heatmap body as a raster image. The png file generated has the size of raster_quality*width and raster_quality*height. So a larger raster_quality value gives you a better reservation of the original resolution. # code only for demonstration Heatmap(mat, use_raster = TRUE, raster_quality = 2) In Complexheatmap, use_raster is by default turned on if the number of rows or columns is more than 2000. Following example compares the PDF file size with raster image by different devices. set.seed(123) mat2 = matrix(rnorm(10000*100), ncol = 100) pdf(&quot;heatmap.pdf&quot;, width = 8, height = 8) Heatmap(mat2, cluster_rows = FALSE, cluster_columns = FALSE, use_raster = FALSE) dev.off() pdf(&quot;heatmap_raster_by_png.pdf&quot;, width = 8, height = 8) Heatmap(mat2, cluster_rows = FALSE, cluster_columns = FALSE, use_raster = TRUE, raster_device = &quot;png&quot;) dev.off() pdf(&quot;heatmap_raster_by_jpeg.pdf&quot;, width = 8, height = 8) Heatmap(mat2, cluster_rows = FALSE, cluster_columns = FALSE, use_raster = TRUE, raster_device = &quot;jpeg&quot;) dev.off() pdf(&quot;heatmap_raster_by_tiff.pdf&quot;, width = 8, height = 8) Heatmap(mat2, cluster_rows = FALSE, cluster_columns = FALSE, use_raster = TRUE, raster_device = &quot;tiff&quot;) dev.off() pdf(&quot;heatmap_raster_by_CairoPNG.pdf&quot;, width = 8, height = 8) Heatmap(mat2, cluster_rows = FALSE, cluster_columns = FALSE, use_raster = TRUE, raster_device = &quot;CairoPNG&quot;) dev.off() pdf(&quot;heatmap_raster_by_CairoJPEG.pdf&quot;, width = 8, height = 8) Heatmap(mat2, cluster_rows = FALSE, cluster_columns = FALSE, use_raster = TRUE, raster_device = &quot;CairoJPEG&quot;) dev.off() all_files = c(&quot;heatmap.pdf&quot;, &quot;heatmap_raster_by_png.pdf&quot;, &quot;heatmap_raster_by_jpeg.pdf&quot;, &quot;heatmap_raster_by_tiff.pdf&quot;, &quot;heatmap_raster_by_CairoPNG.pdf&quot;, &quot;heatmap_raster_by_CairoJPEG.pdf&quot;) fs = file.size(all_files) names(fs) = all_files sapply(fs, function(x) paste(round(x/1024), &quot;KB&quot;)) ## heatmap.pdf heatmap_raster_by_png.pdf ## &quot;6583 KB&quot; &quot;374 KB&quot; ## heatmap_raster_by_jpeg.pdf heatmap_raster_by_tiff.pdf ## &quot;2845 KB&quot; &quot;374 KB&quot; ## heatmap_raster_by_CairoPNG.pdf heatmap_raster_by_CairoJPEG.pdf ## &quot;307 KB&quot; &quot;2975 KB&quot; 2.9 Customize the heatmap body The heatmap body can be self-defined to add more types of graphics. By default the heatmap body is composed by a matrix of small rectangles (it might be called grids in other parts of this documentation, but let’s call it “cells” here) with different filled colors. However, it is also possible to add more graphics or symbols as additional layers on the heatmap. There are two arguments cell_fun and layer_fun which both should be user-defined functions. 2.9.1 cell_fun cell_fun draws in each cell repeatedly, which is internally executed in two nested for loops, while layer_fun is the vectorized version of cell_fun. cell_fun is easier to understand but layer_fun is much faster to execute and more customizable. cell_fun expects a function with 7 arguments (the argument names can be different from following, but the order must be the same), which are: j: column index in the matrix. Column index corresponds to the x-direction in the viewport, that’s why j is put as the first argument. i: row index in the matrix. x: x coordinate of middle point of the cell which is measured in the viewport of the heatmap body. y: y coordinate of middle point of the cell which is measured in the viewport of the heatmap body. width: width of the cell. The value is unit(1/ncol(sub_mat), \"npc\") where sub_mat correspond to the sub-matrix by row splitting and column splitting. height: height of the cell. The value is unit(1/nrow(sub_mat), \"npc\"). fill: color of the cell. The values for the seven arguments are automatically sent to the function when executed in each cell. The most common use is to add values in the matrix onto the heatmap: small_mat = mat[1:9, 1:9] col_fun = colorRamp2(c(-2, 0, 2), c(&quot;green&quot;, &quot;white&quot;, &quot;red&quot;)) Heatmap(small_mat, name = &quot;mat&quot;, col = col_fun, cell_fun = function(j, i, x, y, width, height, fill) { grid.text(sprintf(&quot;%.1f&quot;, small_mat[i, j]), x, y, gp = gpar(fontsize = 10)) }) and we can also choose only to add text for the cells with positive values: Heatmap(small_mat, name = &quot;mat&quot;, col = col_fun, cell_fun = function(j, i, x, y, width, height, fill) { if(small_mat[i, j] &gt; 0) grid.text(sprintf(&quot;%.1f&quot;, small_mat[i, j]), x, y, gp = gpar(fontsize = 10)) }) You can split the heatmap without doing anything extra to cell_fun: Heatmap(small_mat, name = &quot;mat&quot;, col = col_fun, row_km = 2, column_km = 2, cell_fun = function(j, i, x, y, width, height, fill) { grid.text(sprintf(&quot;%.1f&quot;, small_mat[i, j]), x, y, gp = gpar(fontsize = 10)) }) In following example, we make a heatmap which shows correlation matrix similar as the corrplot package: cor_mat = cor(small_mat) od = hclust(dist(cor_mat))$order cor_mat = cor_mat[od, od] nm = rownames(cor_mat) col_fun = circlize::colorRamp2(c(-1, 0, 1), c(&quot;green&quot;, &quot;white&quot;, &quot;red&quot;)) # `col = col_fun` here is used to generate the legend Heatmap(cor_mat, name = &quot;correlation&quot;, col = col_fun, rect_gp = gpar(type = &quot;none&quot;), cell_fun = function(j, i, x, y, width, height, fill) { grid.rect(x = x, y = y, width = width, height = height, gp = gpar(col = &quot;grey&quot;, fill = NA)) if(i == j) { grid.text(nm[i], x = x, y = y) } else if(i &gt; j) { grid.circle(x = x, y = y, r = abs(cor_mat[i, j])/2 * min(unit.c(width, height)), gp = gpar(fill = col_fun(cor_mat[i, j]), col = NA)) } else { grid.text(sprintf(&quot;%.1f&quot;, cor_mat[i, j]), x, y, gp = gpar(fontsize = 10)) } }, cluster_rows = FALSE, cluster_columns = FALSE, show_row_names = FALSE, show_column_names = FALSE) As you may see in previous plot, when setting the non-standard parameter rect_gp = gpar(type = \"none\"), the clustering is performed but nothing is drawn on the heatmap body. One last example is to visualize a GO game. The input data takes records of moves in the game. str = &quot;B[cp];W[pq];B[dc];W[qd];B[eq];W[od];B[de];W[jc];B[qk];W[qn] ;B[qh];W[ck];B[ci];W[cn];B[hc];W[je];B[jq];W[df];B[ee];W[cf] ;B[ei];W[bc];B[ce];W[be];B[bd];W[cd];B[bf];W[ad];B[bg];W[cc] ;B[eb];W[db];B[ec];W[lq];B[nq];W[jp];B[iq];W[kq];B[pp];W[op] ;B[po];W[oq];B[rp];W[ql];B[oo];W[no];B[pl];W[pm];B[np];W[qq] ;B[om];W[ol];B[pk];W[qp];B[on];W[rm];B[mo];W[nr];B[rl];W[rk] ;B[qm];W[dp];B[dq];W[ql];B[or];W[mp];B[nn];W[mq];B[qm];W[bp] ;B[co];W[ql];B[no];W[pr];B[qm];W[dd];B[pn];W[ed];B[bo];W[eg] ;B[ef];W[dg];B[ge];W[gh];B[gf];W[gg];B[ek];W[ig];B[fd];W[en] ;B[bn];W[ip];B[dm];W[ff];B[cb];W[fe];B[hp];W[ho];B[hq];W[el] ;B[dl];W[fk];B[ej];W[fp];B[go];W[hn];B[fo];W[em];B[dn];W[eo] ;B[gp];W[ib];B[gc];W[pg];B[qg];W[ng];B[qc];W[re];B[pf];W[of] ;B[rc];W[ob];B[ph];W[qo];B[rn];W[mi];B[og];W[oe];B[qe];W[rd] ;B[rf];W[pd];B[gm];W[gl];B[fm];W[fl];B[lj];W[mj];B[lk];W[ro] ;B[hl];W[hk];B[ik];W[dk];B[bi];W[di];B[dj];W[dh];B[hj];W[gj] ;B[li];W[lh];B[kh];W[lg];B[jn];W[do];B[cl];W[ij];B[gk];W[bl] ;B[cm];W[hk];B[jk];W[lo];B[hi];W[hm];B[gk];W[bm];B[cn];W[hk] ;B[il];W[cq];B[bq];W[ii];B[sm];W[jo];B[kn];W[fq];B[ep];W[cj] ;B[bk];W[er];B[cr];W[gr];B[gk];W[fj];B[ko];W[kp];B[hr];W[jr] ;B[nh];W[mh];B[mk];W[bb];B[da];W[jh];B[ic];W[id];B[hb];W[jb] ;B[oj];W[fn];B[fs];W[fr];B[gs];W[es];B[hs];W[gn];B[kr];W[is] ;B[dr];W[fi];B[bj];W[hd];B[gd];W[ln];B[lm];W[oi];B[oh];W[ni] ;B[pi];W[ki];B[kj];W[ji];B[so];W[rq];B[if];W[jf];B[hh];W[hf] ;B[he];W[ie];B[hg];W[ba];B[ca];W[sp];B[im];W[sn];B[rm];W[pe] ;B[qf];W[if];B[hk];W[nj];B[nk];W[lr];B[mn];W[af];B[ag];W[ch] ;B[bh];W[lp];B[ia];W[ja];B[ha];W[sf];B[sg];W[se];B[eh];W[fh] ;B[in];W[ih];B[ae];W[so];B[af]&quot; We convert it into a matrix: str = gsub(&quot;\\\\n&quot;, &quot;&quot;, str) step = strsplit(str, &quot;;&quot;)[[1]] type = gsub(&quot;(B|W).*&quot;, &quot;\\\\1&quot;, step) row = gsub(&quot;(B|W)\\\\[(.).\\\\]&quot;, &quot;\\\\2&quot;, step) column = gsub(&quot;(B|W)\\\\[.(.)\\\\]&quot;, &quot;\\\\2&quot;, step) go_mat = matrix(nrow = 19, ncol = 19) rownames(go_mat) = letters[1:19] colnames(go_mat) = letters[1:19] for(i in seq_along(row)) { go_mat[row[i], column[i]] = type[i] } go_mat[1:4, 1:4] ## a b c d ## a NA NA NA &quot;W&quot; ## b &quot;W&quot; &quot;W&quot; &quot;W&quot; &quot;B&quot; ## c &quot;B&quot; &quot;B&quot; &quot;W&quot; &quot;W&quot; ## d &quot;B&quot; &quot;W&quot; &quot;B&quot; &quot;W&quot; Black and white stones are put based on the values in the matrix: Heatmap(go_mat, name = &quot;go&quot;, rect_gp = gpar(type = &quot;none&quot;), cell_fun = function(j, i, x, y, w, h, col) { grid.rect(x, y, w, h, gp = gpar(fill = &quot;#dcb35c&quot;, col = NA)) if(i == 1) { grid.segments(x, y-h*0.5, x, y) } else if(i == nrow(go_mat)) { grid.segments(x, y, x, y+h*0.5) } else { grid.segments(x, y-h*0.5, x, y+h*0.5) } if(j == 1) { grid.segments(x, y, x+w*0.5, y) } else if(j == ncol(go_mat)) { grid.segments(x-w*0.5, y, x, y) } else { grid.segments(x-w*0.5, y, x+w*0.5, y) } if(i %in% c(4, 10, 16) &amp; j %in% c(4, 10, 16)) { grid.points(x, y, pch = 16, size = unit(2, &quot;mm&quot;)) } r = min(unit.c(w, h))*0.45 if(is.na(go_mat[i, j])) { } else if(go_mat[i, j] == &quot;W&quot;) { grid.circle(x, y, r, gp = gpar(fill = &quot;white&quot;, col = &quot;white&quot;)) } else if(go_mat[i, j] == &quot;B&quot;) { grid.circle(x, y, r, gp = gpar(fill = &quot;black&quot;, col = &quot;black&quot;)) } }, col = c(&quot;B&quot; = &quot;black&quot;, &quot;W&quot; = &quot;white&quot;), show_row_names = FALSE, show_column_names = FALSE, column_title = &quot;One famous GO game&quot;, heatmap_legend_param = list(title = &quot;Player&quot;, at = c(&quot;B&quot;, &quot;W&quot;), labels = c(&quot;player1&quot;, &quot;player2&quot;), border = &quot;black&quot;) ) 2.9.2 layer_fun cell_fun adds graphics cell by cell, while layer_fun adds graphics in a block-wise manner. Similar as cell_fun, layer_fun also needs seven arguments, but they are all in vector form (layer_fun can also have a eighth and ninth arguments which is introduced later this section): # code only for demonstration Heatmap(..., layer_fun = function(j, i, x, y, w, h, fill) {...}) # on you can capitalize the arguments to mark they are vectors Heatmap(..., layer_fun = function(J, I, X, Y, W, H, F) {...}) j and i still contain the column and row indices corresponding to the original matrix, but since now layer_fun applies to a block of cells (or a block of heatmap if the heatmap is split), j and i are vectors for all the cells in the current heatmap slice. Similarlly, x, y, w, h and fill are all vectors corresponding to all cells in the current heatmap slice. Since j and i now are vectors, to get corresponding values in the matrix, we cannot use the form as mat[j, i] because it gives you a sub-matrix with length(i) rows and length(j) columns. Instead we can use pindex() function from ComplexHeatmap which is like pairwise indexing for a matrix. See follow example: mfoo = matrix(1:9, nr = 3) mfoo[1:2, c(1, 3)] ## [,1] [,2] ## [1,] 1 7 ## [2,] 2 8 # but we actually want mfoo[1, 1] and mfoo[2, 3] pindex(mfoo, 1:2, c(1, 3)) ## [1] 1 8 Next example shows the layer_fun version of adding text on heatmap. It’s basically the same as the cell_fun version. col_fun = colorRamp2(c(-2, 0, 2), c(&quot;green&quot;, &quot;white&quot;, &quot;red&quot;)) Heatmap(small_mat, name = &quot;mat&quot;, col = col_fun, layer_fun = function(j, i, x, y, width, height, fill) { # since grid.text can also be vectorized grid.text(sprintf(&quot;%.1f&quot;, pindex(small_mat, i, j)), x, y, gp = gpar(fontsize = 10)) }) And only add text to cells with positive values: Heatmap(small_mat, name = &quot;mat&quot;, col = col_fun, layer_fun = function(j, i, x, y, width, height, fill) { v = pindex(small_mat, i, j) l = v &gt; 0 grid.text(sprintf(&quot;%.1f&quot;, v[l]), x[l], y[l], gp = gpar(fontsize = 10)) }) When the heatmap is split, layer_fun is applied in every slice. Heatmap(small_mat, name = &quot;mat&quot;, col = col_fun, row_km = 2, column_km = 2, layer_fun = function(j, i, x, y, width, height, fill) { v = pindex(small_mat, i, j) grid.text(sprintf(&quot;%.1f&quot;, v), x, y, gp = gpar(fontsize = 10)) if(sum(v &gt; 0)/length(v) &gt; 0.75) { grid.rect(gp = gpar(lwd = 2, fill = &quot;transparent&quot;)) } }) layer_fun can also have two more arguments which are the index for the current row slice and column slice. E.g. we want to add borders for the top right and bottom left slices. Heatmap(small_mat, name = &quot;mat&quot;, col = col_fun, row_km = 2, column_km = 2, layer_fun = function(j, i, x, y, width, height, fill, slice_r, slice_c) { v = pindex(small_mat, i, j) grid.text(sprintf(&quot;%.1f&quot;, v), x, y, gp = gpar(fontsize = 10)) if(slice_r != slice_c) { grid.rect(gp = gpar(lwd = 2, fill = &quot;transparent&quot;)) } }) The advantage of lay_fun is it is not only fast to add graphics, but also it provides more possibilities to customize the heatmap. Consider following visualization: For each row in the heatmap, if values in the neighbouring two columns have the same sign, we add a red line or a green line depending on the sign of the two values. (Don’t be frightened by following code. They are explained after the code.) Heatmap(small_mat, name = &quot;mat&quot;, col = col_fun, row_km = 2, column_km = 2, layer_fun = function(j, i, x, y, w, h, fill) { # restore_matrix() is explained after this chunk of code ind_mat = restore_matrix(j, i, x, y) for(ir in seq_len(nrow(ind_mat))) { # start from the second column for(ic in seq_len(ncol(ind_mat))[-1]) { ind1 = ind_mat[ir, ic-1] # previous column ind2 = ind_mat[ir, ic] # current column v1 = small_mat[i[ind1], j[ind1]] v2 = small_mat[i[ind2], j[ind2]] if(v1 * v2 &gt; 0) { # if they have the same sign col = ifelse(v1 &gt; 0, &quot;darkred&quot;, &quot;darkgreen&quot;) grid.segments(x[ind1], y[ind1], x[ind2], y[ind2], gp = gpar(col = col, lwd = 2)) grid.points(x[c(ind1, ind2)], y[c(ind1, ind2)], pch = 16, gp = gpar(col = col), size = unit(4, &quot;mm&quot;)) } } } } ) The values that are sent to layer_fun are all vectors (for the vectorization of the grid graphic functions), however, the heatmap slice where layer_fun is applied to, is still represented by a matrix, thus, it would be very convinient if all the arguments in layer_fun can be converted to the sub-matrix for the current slice. Here, as shown in above example, restore_matrix() does the job. restore_matrix() directly accepts the first four argument in layer_fun and returns an index matrix, where rows and columns correspond to the rows and columns in the current slice, from top to bottom and from left to right. The values in the matrix are the natural order of e.g. vector j in current slice. If you run following code: Heatmap(small_mat, name = &quot;mat&quot;, col = col_fun, row_km = 2, column_km = 2, layer_fun = function(j, i, x, y, w, h, fill) { ind_mat = restore_matrix(j, i, x, y) print(ind_mat) } ) The first output which is for the top-left slice: [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [1,] 1 4 7 10 13 [2,] 2 5 8 11 14 [3,] 3 6 9 12 15 As you see, this is a three-row and five-column index matrix where the first row corresponds to the top row in the slice. The values in the matrix correspond to the natural index (i.e. 1, 2, …) in j, i, x, y, … in layer_fun. Now, if we want to add values on the second column in the top-left slice, the code which is put inside layer_fun would look like: for(ind in ind_mat[, 2]) { grid.text(small_mat[i[ind], j[ind]], x[ind], y[ind], ...) } Now it is easier to understand the second example: we want to add points to the second row and the third column in every slice: Heatmap(small_mat, name = &quot;mat&quot;, col = col_fun, row_km = 2, column_km = 2, layer_fun = function(j, i, x, y, w, h, fill) { ind_mat = restore_matrix(j, i, x, y) ind = unique(c(ind_mat[2, ], ind_mat[, 3])) grid.points(x[ind], y[ind], pch = 16, size = unit(4, &quot;mm&quot;)) } ) 2.10 Size of the heatmap width, heatmap_width, height and heatmap_height control the size of the heatmap. By default, all heatmap components have fixed width or height, e.g. the width of row dendrogram is 1cm. The width or the height of the heatmap body fill the rest area of the final plotting region, which means, if you draw it in an interactive graphic window and you change the size of the window by draging it, the size of the heatmap body is automatically adjusted. heatmap_width and heatmap_height control the width/height of the complete heatmap including all heatmap components (excluding the legends) while width and height only control the width/height of the heamtap body. All these four arguments can be set as absolute units. Heatmap(mat, name = &quot;mat&quot;, width = unit(8, &quot;cm&quot;), height = unit(8, &quot;cm&quot;)) Heatmap(mat, name = &quot;mat&quot;, heatmap_width = unit(8, &quot;cm&quot;), heatmap_height = unit(8, &quot;cm&quot;)) These four arguments are more important when adjust the size in a list of heatmaps (see Section 4.2). When the size of the heatmap is set as absolute units, it is possible that the size of the figure is larger than the size of the plot, which gives blank areas around the plot. The size of the heatmap can be retrieved by width() and height() functions. ht = Heatmap(mat, name = &quot;mat&quot;, width = unit(8, &quot;cm&quot;), height = unit(8, &quot;cm&quot;)) ht = draw(ht) ComplexHeatmap:::width(ht) ## [1] 118.985533333333mm ComplexHeatmap:::height(ht) ## [1] 114.8515mm ht = Heatmap(mat, name = &quot;mat&quot;, heatmap_width = unit(8, &quot;cm&quot;), heatmap_height = unit(8, &quot;cm&quot;)) ht = draw(ht) ComplexHeatmap:::width(ht) ## [1] 95.0216666666667mm ComplexHeatmap:::height(ht) ## [1] 84mm 2.11 Plot the heatmap Heatmap() function actually is only a constructor, which means it only puts all the data and configurations into the object in the Heatmap class. The clustering will only be performed when the draw() method is called. Under interactive mode (e.g. the interactive R terminal where you can type your R code line by line), directly calling Heatmap() without returning to any object prints the object and the print method (or the S4 show() method) for the Heatmap class object calls draw() internally. So if you type Heatmap(...) in your R terminal, it looks like it is a plotting function like plot(), you need to be aware of that it is actually not true and in the following cases you might see nothing plotted. you put Heatmap(...) inside a function, you put Heatmap(...) in a code chunk like for or if-else you put Heatmap(...) in an Rscript and you run it under command line. The reason is in above three cases, the show() method WILL NOT be called and thus draw() method is not executed either. So, to make the plot, you need to call draw() explicitly: draw(Heatmap(...)) or: # code only for demonstration ht = Heatmap(...) draw(ht) The draw() function actually is applied to a list of heatmaps in HeatmapList class. The draw() method for the single Heatmap class constructs a HeatmapList with only one heatmap and call draw() method of the HeatmapList class. The draw() function accpets a lot of more arguments which e.g. controls the legends. It will be discussed in Chapter 4. draw(ht, heatmap_legend_side, padding, ...) 2.12 Get orders and dendrograms The row/column orders of the heatmap can be obtained by row_order()/column_order() functions. You can directly apply to the heatmap object returned by Heatmap() or to the object returned by draw(). In following, we take row_order() as example. small_mat = mat[1:9, 1:9] ht1 = Heatmap(small_mat) row_order(ht1) ## [1] 5 7 2 4 9 6 8 1 3 ht2 = draw(ht1) row_order(ht2) ## [1] 5 7 2 4 9 6 8 1 3 As explained in previous section, Heatmap() function does not perform clustering, thus, when directly apply row_order() on ht1, clustering will be first performed. Later when making the heatmap by draw(ht1), the clustering will be applied again. This might be a problem that if you set k-means clustering in the heatmap. Since the clustering is applied twice, k-means might give you different clusterings, which means, you might have different results from row_order() and you might have different heatmap. In following chunk of code, o1, o2 and o3 might be different because each time, k-means clustering is performed. # code only for demonstration ht1 = Heatmap(small_mat, row_km = 2) o1 = row_order(ht1) o2 = row_order(ht1) ht2 = draw(ht1) o3 = row_order(ht2) o4 = row_order(ht2) draw() function returns the heatmap (or more precisely, the heatmap list) which has already been reordered, and applying row_order() just extracts the row order from the object, which ensures the row order is exactly the same as the one shown in the heatmap. In above code, o3 is always identical to o4. So, the preferable way to get row/column orders is as follows. # code only for demonstration ht = Heatmap(small_mat) ht = draw(ht) row_order(ht) column_order(ht) If rows/columns are split, row order or column order will be a list. ht = Heatmap(small_mat, row_km = 2, column_km = 3) ht = draw(ht) row_order(ht) ## $`1` ## [1] 9 6 8 1 3 ## ## $`2` ## [1] 5 7 2 4 column_order(ht) ## $`1` ## [1] 6 2 7 ## ## $`2` ## [1] 8 9 ## ## $`3` ## [1] 1 3 4 5 Similarly, the row_dend()/column_dend() functions return the dendrograms. It returns a single dendrogram or a list of dendrograms depending on whether the heatmap is split. ht = Heatmap(small_mat, row_km = 2) ht = draw(ht) row_dend(ht) ## $`1` ## &#39;dendrogram&#39; with 2 branches and 5 members total, at height 2.681351 ## ## $`2` ## &#39;dendrogram&#39; with 2 branches and 4 members total, at height 2.946428 column_dend(ht) ## &#39;dendrogram&#39; with 2 branches and 9 members total, at height 4.574114 row_order(), column_order(), row_dend() and column_dend() also work for a list of heatmaps, it will be introduced in Section 4.12. 2.13 Subset a heatmap Since heatmap is a representation of a matrix, there is also a subset method for the Heatmap class. ht = Heatmap(mat, name = &quot;mat&quot;) dim(ht) ## [1] 18 24 ht[1:10, 1:10] The annotations are subsetted accordingly as well. ht = Heatmap(mat, name = &quot;mat&quot;, row_km = 2, column_km = 3, col = colorRamp2(c(-2, 0, 2), c(&quot;green&quot;, &quot;white&quot;, &quot;red&quot;)), top_annotation = HeatmapAnnotation(foo1 = 1:24, bar1 = anno_points(runif(24))), right_annotation = rowAnnotation(foo2 = 18:1, bar2 = anno_barplot(runif(18))) ) ht[1:9*2 - 1, 1:12*2] # odd rows, even columns The heatmap components are subsetted if they are vector-like. Some configurations in the heatmap keep the same when subsetting, e.g. if row_km is set in the original heatmap, the configuration of k-means is kept and it is performed in the sub-heatmap. So in following example, k-means clustering is only performed when making heatmap for ht2. ht = Heatmap(mat, name = &quot;mat&quot;, row_km = 2) ht2 = ht[1:10, 1:10] ht2 The implementation of subsetting heatmaps is very experimental. It is not always working, e.g. if cell_fun is defined and uses an external matrix, or clustering objects are assigned to cluster_rows or cluster_columns. There are also subset methods for the HeatmapAnnotation class (Section 3.19) and the HeatmapList class (Section 4.10), but both are very experimental as well. "],

ComplexHeatmap package provides very flexible supports for setting annotations and defining new annotation graphics. The annotations can be put on the four sides of the heatmap, by top_annotation, bottom_annotation, left_annotation and right_annotation arguments. The value for the four arguments should be in the HeatmapAnnotation class and should be constructed by HeatmapAnnotation() function, or by rowAnnotation() function if it is a row annotation. (rowAnnotation() is just a helper function which is identical to HeatmapAnnotation(..., which = \"row\")) A simple usage of heatmap annotations is as follows. set.seed(123) mat = matrix(rnorm(100), 10) rownames(mat) = paste0(&quot;R&quot;, 1:10) colnames(mat) = paste0(&quot;C&quot;, 1:10) column_ha = HeatmapAnnotation(foo1 = runif(10), bar1 = anno_barplot(runif(10))) row_ha = rowAnnotation(foo2 = runif(10), bar2 = anno_barplot(runif(10))) Heatmap(mat, name = &quot;mat&quot;, top_annotation = column_ha, right_annotation = row_ha) Or assign as bottom annotation and left annotation. Heatmap(mat, name = &quot;mat&quot;, bottom_annotation = column_ha, left_annotation = row_ha) In above examples, column_ha and row_ha both have two annotations where foo1 and foo2 are numeric vectors and bar1 and bar2 are barplots. The vector-like annotation is called “simple annotation” here and the barplot annotation is called “complex annotation”. You can already see the annotations must be defined as name-value pairs (e.g. foo = ...). Heatmap annotations can also be independent of the heatmaps. They can be concatenated to the heatmap list by + if it is horizontal or %v% if it is vertical. Chapter 4 will discuss how to concatenate heatmaps and annotations. # code only for demonstration Heatmap(...) + rowAnnotation() + ... Heatmap(...) %v% HeatmapAnnotation(...) + ... HeatmapAnnotation() returns a HeatmapAnnotation class object. The object is usually composed of several annotations. If following sections of this chapter, we first introduce settings for individal annotation, and later we show how to put them toghether. You can see the information of the column_ha and row_ha objects: column_ha ## A HeatmapAnnotation object with 2 annotations ## name: heatmap_annotation_0 ## position: column ## items: 10 ## width: 1npc ## height: 15.3514598035146mm ## this object is subsetable ## 5.92288888888889mm extension on the left ## 9.4709mm extension on the right ## ## name annotation_type color_mapping height ## foo1 continuous vector random 5mm ## bar1 anno_barplot() 10mm row_ha ## A HeatmapAnnotation object with 2 annotations ## name: heatmap_annotation_1 ## position: row ## items: 10 ## width: 15.3514598035146mm ## height: 1npc ## this object is subsetable ## 9.96242222222222mm extension on the bottom ## ## name annotation_type color_mapping width ## foo2 continuous vector random 5mm ## bar2 anno_barplot() 10mm In following examples in this chapter, we will only show the graphics for the annotations with no heatmap, unless it is necessary. If you want to try it with a heatmap, you just assign the HeatmapAnnotation object which we always name as ha to top_annotation, bottom_annotation, left_annotation or right_annotation arguments. Settings are basically the same for column annotations and row annotations. If there is nothing specicial, we only show the column annotation as examples. If you want to try row annotation, just add which = \"row\" to HeatmapAnnotation() or directly change to rowAnnotation() function. 3.1 Simple annotation A so-called “simple annotation” is the most used style of annotations which is heatmap-like or grid-like graphics where colors are used to map to the anntation values. To generate a simple annotation, you just simply put the annotation vector in HeatmapAnnotation() with a specific name. ha = HeatmapAnnotation(foo = 1:10) Or a discrete annotation: ha = HeatmapAnnotation(bar = sample(letters[1:3], 10, replace = TRUE)) You can use any strings as annotation names except those pre-defined arguments in HeatmapAnnotation(). If colors are not specified, colors are randomly generated. To set the colors for annotation, col needs to be set as a named list. For continuous values, the color mapping should be a color mapping function generated by circlize::colorRamp2(). library(circlize) col_fun = colorRamp2(c(0, 5, 10), c(&quot;blue&quot;, &quot;white&quot;, &quot;red&quot;)) ha = HeatmapAnnotation(foo = 1:10, col = list(foo = col_fun)) And for discrete annotations, the color should be a named vector where names correspond to the levels in the annotation. ha = HeatmapAnnotation(bar = sample(letters[1:3], 10, replace = TRUE), col = list(bar = c(&quot;a&quot; = &quot;red&quot;, &quot;b&quot; = &quot;green&quot;, &quot;c&quot; = &quot;blue&quot;))) If you specify more than one vectors, there will be multiple annotations (foo and bar in following example). Also you can see how col is set when foo and bar are all put into a single HeatmapAnnotation(). Maybe now you can understand the names in the color list is actually used to map to the annotation names. Values in col will be used to construct legends for simple annotations. ha = HeatmapAnnotation( foo = 1:10, bar = sample(letters[1:3], 10, replace = TRUE), col = list(foo = col_fun, bar = c(&quot;a&quot; = &quot;red&quot;, &quot;b&quot; = &quot;green&quot;, &quot;c&quot; = &quot;blue&quot;) ) ) The color for NA value is controlled by na_col argument. ha = HeatmapAnnotation( foo = c(1:4, NA, 6:10), bar = c(NA, sample(letters[1:3], 9, replace = TRUE)), col = list(foo = col_fun, bar = c(&quot;a&quot; = &quot;red&quot;, &quot;b&quot; = &quot;green&quot;, &quot;c&quot; = &quot;blue&quot;) ), na_col = &quot;black&quot; ) gp mainly controls the graphic parameters for the borders of the grids. ha = HeatmapAnnotation( foo = 1:10, bar = sample(letters[1:3], 10, replace = TRUE), col = list(foo = col_fun, bar = c(&quot;a&quot; = &quot;red&quot;, &quot;b&quot; = &quot;green&quot;, &quot;c&quot; = &quot;blue&quot;) ), gp = gpar(col = &quot;black&quot;) ) The simple annotation can also be a matrix (numeric or character) that all the columns in the matrix share a same color mapping schema. Note columns in the matrix correspond to the rows in the column annotation. Also the column names of the matrix are used as the annotation names. ha = HeatmapAnnotation(foo = cbind(a = runif(10), b = runif(10))) If the matrix has no column name, the name of the annotation is still used, but drawn in the middle of the annotation. ha = HeatmapAnnotation(foo = cbind(runif(10), runif(10))) As simple annotations can be in different modes (e.g. numeric, or character), they can be combined as a data frame and send to df argument. Imaging in your project, you might already have an annotation table, you can directly set it by df. anno_df = data.frame(foo = 1:10, bar = sample(letters[1:3], 10, replace = TRUE)) ha = HeatmapAnnotation(df = anno_df, col = list(foo = col_fun, bar = c(&quot;a&quot; = &quot;red&quot;, &quot;b&quot; = &quot;green&quot;, &quot;c&quot; = &quot;blue&quot;) ) ) Single annotations and data frame can be mixed. In following example, colors for foo2 is not specified, random colors will be used. ha = HeatmapAnnotation(df = anno_df, foo2 = rnorm(10), col = list(foo = col_fun, bar = c(&quot;a&quot; = &quot;red&quot;, &quot;b&quot; = &quot;green&quot;, &quot;c&quot; = &quot;blue&quot;) ) ) border controls the border of every single annotation. ha = HeatmapAnnotation( foo = cbind(1:10, 10:1), bar = sample(letters[1:3], 10, replace = TRUE), col = list(foo = col_fun, bar = c(&quot;a&quot; = &quot;red&quot;, &quot;b&quot; = &quot;green&quot;, &quot;c&quot; = &quot;blue&quot;) ), border = TRUE ) The height of the simple annotation is controlled by simple_anno_size argument. Since all single annotations have same height, the value of simple_anno_size is a single unit value. Note there are arguments like width, height, annotation_width and annotation_height, but they are used to adjust the width/height for the complete heamtap annotations (which are always mix of several annotations). The adjustment of these four arguments will be introduced in Section 3.18. ha = HeatmapAnnotation( foo = cbind(a = 1:10, b = 10:1), bar = sample(letters[1:3], 10, replace = TRUE), col = list(foo = col_fun, bar = c(&quot;a&quot; = &quot;red&quot;, &quot;b&quot; = &quot;green&quot;, &quot;c&quot; = &quot;blue&quot;) ), simple_anno_size = unit(1, &quot;cm&quot;) ) When you have multiple heatmaps and it is better to keep the size of simple annotations on all heatmaps with the same size. ht_opt$simple_anno_size can be set to control the simple annotation size globally (It will be introduced in Section 4.13). 3.2 Simple annotation as an annotation function HeatmapAnnotation() supports “complex annotation” by setting the annotation as a function. The annotation function defines how to draw the graphics at a certain position corresponding to the column or row in the heatmap. There are quite a lot of annotation functions predefined in ComplexHeatmap package. In the end of this chapter, we will introduce how to construct your own annotation function by the AnnotationFunction class. For all the annotation functions in forms of anno_*(), if it is specified in HeatmapAnnotation() or rowAnnotation(), you don’t need to do anything explicitly on anno_*() to tell whether it should be drawn on rows or columns. anno_*() automatically detects whether it is a row annotation environment or a column annotation environment. The simple annotation shown in previous section is internally constructed by anno_simple() annotation function. Directly using anno_simple() will not automatically generate legends for the final plot, but, it can provide more flexibility for more annotation graphics (note In Chapter 5 we will show, although anno_simple() cannot automatically generate the legends, the legends can be controlled and added to the final plot manually). For an example in previous section: # code only for demonstration ha = HeatmapAnnotation(foo = 1:10) is actually identical to: # code only for demonstration ha = HeatmapAnnotation(foo = anno_simple(1:10)) anno_simple() makes heatmap-like annotations (or the simple annotations). Basically if users only make heatmap-like annotations, they do not need to directly use anno_simple(), but this function allows to add more symbols on the annotation grids. anno_simple() allows to add “points” or single-letter symbols on top of the annotation grids. pch, pt_gp and pt_size control the settings of the points. The value of pch can be a vector with possible NA values. ha = HeatmapAnnotation(foo = anno_simple(1:10, pch = 1, pt_gp = gpar(col = &quot;red&quot;), pt_size = unit(1:10, &quot;mm&quot;))) Set pch as a vector: ha = HeatmapAnnotation(foo = anno_simple(1:10, pch = 1:10)) Set pch as a vector of letters: ha = HeatmapAnnotation(foo = anno_simple(1:10, pch = sample(letters[1:3], 10, replace = TRUE))) Set pch as a vector with NA values (nothing is drawn for NA pch values): ha = HeatmapAnnotation(foo = anno_simple(1:10, pch = c(1:4, NA, 6:8, NA, 10, 11))) pch also works if the value for anno_simple() is a matrix. The length of pch should be as same as the number of matrix rows or columns or even the length of the matrix (the length of the matrix is the length of all data points in the matrix). Length of pch corresponds to matrix columns: ha = HeatmapAnnotation(foo = anno_simple(cbind(1:10, 10:1), pch = 1:2)) Lenght of pch corresponds to matrix rows: ha = HeatmapAnnotation(foo = anno_simple(cbind(1:10, 10:1), pch = 1:10)) pch is a matrix: pch = matrix(1:20, nc = 2) pch[sample(length(pch), 10)] = NA ha = HeatmapAnnotation(foo = anno_simple(cbind(1:10, 10:1), pch = pch)) Till now, you might wonder how to set the legends of the symbols you’ve added to the simple annotations. Here we will only show you a simple example and this functionality will be discussed in Chapter 5. In following example, we assume the simple annotations are kind of p-values and we add * for p-values less than 0.01. set.seed(123) pvalue = 10^-runif(10, min = 0, max = 3) is_sig = pvalue &lt; 0.01 pch = rep(&quot;*&quot;, 10) pch[!is_sig] = NA # color mapping for -log10(pvalue) pvalue_col_fun = colorRamp2(c(0, 2, 3), c(&quot;green&quot;, &quot;white&quot;, &quot;red&quot;)) ha = HeatmapAnnotation( pvalue = anno_simple(-log10(pvalue), col = pvalue_col_fun, pch = pch), annotation_name_side = &quot;left&quot;) ht = Heatmap(matrix(rnorm(100), 10), name = &quot;mat&quot;, top_annotation = ha) # now we generate two legends, one for the p-value # see how we define the legend for pvalue lgd_pvalue = Legend(title = &quot;p-value&quot;, col = pvalue_col_fun, at = c(0, 1, 2, 3), labels = c(&quot;1&quot;, &quot;0.1&quot;, &quot;0.01&quot;, &quot;0.001&quot;)) # and one for the significant p-values lgd_sig = Legend(pch = &quot;*&quot;, type = &quot;points&quot;, labels = &quot;&lt; 0.01&quot;) # these two self-defined legends are added to the plot by `annotation_legend_list` draw(ht, annotation_legend_list = list(lgd_pvalue, lgd_sig)) The height of the simple annotation can be controled by height argument or simple_anno_size inside anno_simple(). simple_anno_size controls the size for single-row annotation and height/width controls the total height/width of the simple annotations. If height/width is set, simple_anno_size is ignored. ha = HeatmapAnnotation(foo = anno_simple(1:10, height = unit(2, &quot;cm&quot;))) ha = HeatmapAnnotation(foo = anno_simple(cbind(1:10, 10:1), simple_anno_size = unit(2, &quot;cm&quot;))) For all the annotation functions we introduce later, the height or the width for individual annotations should all be set inside the anno_*() functions. # code only for demonstration anno_*(..., width = ...) anno_*(..., height = ...) Again, the width, height, annotation_width and annotation_height arguments in HeatmapAnnotation() are used to adjust the size of multiple annotations. 3.3 Empty annotation anno_empty() is a place holder where nothing is drawn. Later user-defined graphics can be added by decorate_annotation() function. ha = HeatmapAnnotation(foo = anno_empty(border = TRUE)) In Chapter 6, we will introduce the use of the decoration functions, but here we give a quick example. In gene expression expression analysis, there are senarios that we split the heatmaps into several groups and we want to highlight some key genes in each group. In this case, we simply add the gene names on the right side of the heatmap without aligning them to the their corresponding rows. (anno_mark() can align the labels correclty to their corresponding rows, but in the example we show here, it is not necessray). In following example, since rows are split into four slices, the empty annotation is also split into four slices. Basically what we do is in each empty annotation slice, we add a colored segment and text. random_text = function(n) { sapply(1:n, function(i) { paste0(sample(letters, sample(4:10, 1)), collapse = &quot;&quot;) }) } text_list = list( text1 = random_text(4), text2 = random_text(4), text3 = random_text(4), text4 = random_text(4) ) # note how we set the width of this empty annotation ha = rowAnnotation(foo = anno_empty(border = FALSE, width = max_text_width(unlist(text_list)) + unit(4, &quot;mm&quot;))) Heatmap(matrix(rnorm(1000), nrow = 100), name = &quot;mat&quot;, row_km = 4, right_annotation = ha) for(i in 1:4) { decorate_annotation(&quot;foo&quot;, slice = i, { grid.rect(x = 0, width = unit(2, &quot;mm&quot;), gp = gpar(fill = i, col = NA), just = &quot;left&quot;) grid.text(paste(text_list[[i]], collapse = &quot;\\n&quot;), x = unit(4, &quot;mm&quot;), just = &quot;left&quot;) }) } A second use of the empty annotation is to add complex annotation graphics where the empty annotation pretends to be a virtual plotting region. You can construct an annotation function by AnnotationFunction class for complex annotation graphics, which allows subsetting and splitting, but still, it can be a secondary choice to directly draw inside the empty annotation, which is easier and faster for implementing (but less flexible and does not allow splitting). In following we show how to add a “complex version” of points annotation. The only thing that needs to be careful is the location on x-axis (y-axis if it is a row annotation) should correspond to the column index after column reordering. ha = HeatmapAnnotation(foo = anno_empty(border = TRUE, height = unit(3, &quot;cm&quot;))) ht = Heatmap(matrix(rnorm(100), nrow = 10), name = &quot;mat&quot;, top_annotation = ha) ht = draw(ht) co = column_order(ht) value = runif(10) decorate_annotation(&quot;foo&quot;, { # value on x-axis is always 1:ncol(mat) x = 1:10 # while values on y-axis is the value after column reordering value = value[co] pushViewport(viewport(xscale = c(0.5, 10.5), yscale = c(0, 1))) grid.lines(c(0.5, 10.5), c(0.5, 0.5), gp = gpar(lty = 2), default.units = &quot;native&quot;) grid.points(x, value, pch = 16, size = unit(2, &quot;mm&quot;), gp = gpar(col = ifelse(value &gt; 0.5, &quot;red&quot;, &quot;blue&quot;)), default.units = &quot;native&quot;) grid.yaxis(at = c(0, 0.5, 1)) popViewport() }) 3.4 Block annotation The block annotation is more like a color block which identifies groups when the rows or columns of the heatmap are split. Heatmap(matrix(rnorm(100), 10), name = &quot;mat&quot;, top_annotation = HeatmapAnnotation(foo = anno_block(gp = gpar(fill = 2:4))), column_km = 3) Labels can be added to each block. Heatmap(matrix(rnorm(100), 10), top_annotation = HeatmapAnnotation(foo = anno_block(gp = gpar(fill = 2:4), labels = c(&quot;group1&quot;, &quot;group2&quot;, &quot;group3&quot;), labels_gp = gpar(col = &quot;white&quot;, fontsize = 10))), column_km = 3, left_annotation = rowAnnotation(foo = anno_block(gp = gpar(fill = 2:4), labels = c(&quot;group1&quot;, &quot;group2&quot;, &quot;group3&quot;), labels_gp = gpar(col = &quot;white&quot;, fontsize = 10))), row_km = 3) Note the length of labels or graphic parameters should have the same length as the number of slices. 3.5 Image annotation Images can be added as annotations. anno_image() supports image in png, svg, pdf, eps, jpeg/jpg, tiff formats. How they are imported as annotations are as follows: png, jpeg/jpg and tiff images are imported by png::readPNG(), jpeg::readJPEG() and tiff::readTIFF(), and drawn by grid::grid.raster(). svg images are firstly reformatted by rsvg::rsvg_svg() and then imported by grImport2::readPicture() and drawn by grImport2::grid.picture(). pdf and eps images are imported by grImport::PostScriptTrace() and grImport::readPicture(), later drawn by grImport::grid.picture(). The free icons for following examples are from https://github.com/Keyamoon/IcoMoon-Free. A vector of image paths are set as the first argument of anno_image(). image_png = sample(dir(&quot;IcoMoon-Free-master/PNG/64px&quot;, full.names = TRUE), 10) image_svg = sample(dir(&quot;IcoMoon-Free-master/SVG/&quot;, full.names = TRUE), 10) image_eps = sample(dir(&quot;IcoMoon-Free-master/EPS/&quot;, full.names = TRUE), 10) image_pdf = sample(dir(&quot;IcoMoon-Free-master/PDF/&quot;, full.names = TRUE), 10) # we only draw the image annotation for PNG images, while the others are the same ha = HeatmapAnnotation(foo = anno_image(image_png)) Different image formats can be mixed in the input vector. # code only for demonstration ha = HeatmapAnnotation(foo = anno_image(c(image_png[1:3], image_svg[1:3], image_eps[1:3], image_pdf[1:3]))) Border and background colors (if the images have transparent background) can be set by gp. ha = HeatmapAnnotation(foo = anno_image(image_png, gp = gpar(fill = 1:10, col = &quot;black&quot;))) border controls the border of the whole annotation. # code only for demonstration ha = HeatmapAnnotation(foo = anno_image(image_png, border = &quot;red&quot;)) Padding or space around the images is set by space. ha = HeatmapAnnotation(foo = anno_image(image_png, space = unit(3, &quot;mm&quot;))) If only some of the images need to be drawn, the other elements in the image vector can be set to '' or NA. image_png[1:2] = &quot;&quot; ha = HeatmapAnnotation(foo = anno_image(image_png)) 3.6 Points annotation Points annotation implemented as anno_points() shows distribution of a list of data points. The data points object x can be a single vector or a matrix. If it is a matrix, the graphic settings such as pch, size and gp can correpspond to matrix columns. Note again, if x is a matrix, rows in x correspond to columns in the heatmap matrix. ha = HeatmapAnnotation(foo = anno_points(runif(10))) ha = HeatmapAnnotation(foo = anno_points(matrix(runif(20), nc = 2), pch = 1:2, gp = gpar(col = 2:3))) ylim controls the range on “y-axis” or the “data axis” (if it is a row annotation, the data axis is horizontal), extend controls the extended space on the data axis direction. axis controls whether to show the axis and axis_param controls the settings for axis. The default settings for axis are: default_axis_param(&quot;column&quot;) ## $at ## NULL ## ## $labels ## NULL ## ## $labels_rot ## [1] 0 ## ## $gp ## $fontsize ## [1] 8 ## ## ## $side ## [1] &quot;left&quot; ## ## $facing ## [1] &quot;outside&quot; ## ## $direction ## [1] &quot;normal&quot; And you can overwrite some of them: ha = HeatmapAnnotation(foo = anno_points(runif(10), ylim = c(0, 1), axis_param = list( side = &quot;right&quot;, at = c(0, 0.5, 1), labels = c(&quot;zero&quot;, &quot;half&quot;, &quot;one&quot;) )) ) One thing that might be useful is you can control the rotation of the axis labels. ha = rowAnnotation(foo = anno_points(runif(10), ylim = c(0, 1), width = unit(2, &quot;cm&quot;), axis_param = list( side = &quot;bottom&quot;, at = c(0, 0.5, 1), labels = c(&quot;zero&quot;, &quot;half&quot;, &quot;one&quot;), labels_rot = 45 )) ) The configuration of axis is same for other annotation functions which have axes. The default size of the points annotation is 5mm. It can be controlled by height/width argument in anno_points(). # code only for demonstration ha = HeatmapAnnotation(foo = anno_points(runif(10), height = unit(2, &quot;cm&quot;))) 3.7 Lines annotation anno_lines() connects the data points by a list of segments. Similar as anno_points(), the data variable can be a numeric vector: ha = HeatmapAnnotation(foo = anno_lines(runif(10))) Or a matrix: ha = HeatmapAnnotation(foo = anno_lines(cbind(c(1:5, 1:5), c(5:1, 5:1)), gp = gpar(col = 2:3), add_points = TRUE, pt_gp = gpar(col = 5:6), pch = c(1, 16))) As shown above, points can be added to the lines by setting add_points = TRUE. Smoothed lines (by loess()) can be added instead of the original lines by setting smooth = TRUE, but it should be used with caution because the order of columns in the heatmap is used as “x-value” for the fitting and only if you think the fitting against the reordered order makes sense. Smoothing also works when the input data variable is a matrix that the smoothing is performed for each column separately. If smooth is TRUE, add_points is set to TRUE by default. ha = HeatmapAnnotation(foo = anno_lines(runif(10), smooth = TRUE)) The default size of the lines annotation is 5mm. It can be controlled by height/width argument in anno_lines(). # code only for demonstration ha = HeatmapAnnotation(foo = anno_lines(runif(10), height = unit(2, &quot;cm&quot;))) 3.8 Barplot annotation The data points can be represented as barplots. Some of the arguments in anno_barplot() such as ylim, axis, axis_param are the same as anno_points(). ha = HeatmapAnnotation(foo = anno_barplot(1:10)) The width of bars is controlled by bar_width. It is a relative value to the width of the cell in the heatmap. ha = HeatmapAnnotation(foo = anno_barplot(1:10, bar_width = 1)) Graphic parameters are controlled by gp. ha = HeatmapAnnotation(foo = anno_barplot(1:10, gp = gpar(fill = 1:10))) You can choose the baseline of bars by baseline. ha = HeatmapAnnotation(foo = anno_barplot(seq(-5, 5), baseline = &quot;min&quot;)) ha = HeatmapAnnotation(foo = anno_barplot(seq(-5, 5), baseline = 0)) If the input value is a matrix, it will be stacked barplots. ha = HeatmapAnnotation(foo = anno_barplot(matrix(nc = 2, c(1:10, 10:1)))) And length of parameters in gp can be the number of the columns in the matrix: ha = HeatmapAnnotation(foo = anno_barplot(cbind(1:10, 10:1), gp = gpar(fill = 2:3, col = 2:3))) The default size of the barplot annotation is 5mm. It can be controlled by height/width argument in anno_barplot(). # code only for demonstration ha = HeatmapAnnotation(foo = anno_barplot(runif(10), height = unit(2, &quot;cm&quot;))) Following example shows a barplot annotation which visualizes a proportion matrix (for which row sums are 1). m = matrix(runif(4*10), nc = 4) m = t(apply(m, 1, function(x) x/sum(x))) ha = HeatmapAnnotation(foo = anno_barplot(m, gp = gpar(fill = 2:5), bar_width = 1, height = unit(6, &quot;cm&quot;))) The direction of the axis can be reversed which is useful when the annotation is put on the left of the heatmap. ha_list = rowAnnotation(axis_reverse = anno_barplot(m, gp = gpar(fill = 2:5), axis_param = list(direction = &quot;reverse&quot;), bar_width = 1, width = unit(4, &quot;cm&quot;))) + rowAnnotation(axis_normal = anno_barplot(m, gp = gpar(fill = 2:5), bar_width = 1, width = unit(4, &quot;cm&quot;))) draw(ha_list, ht_gap = unit(4, &quot;mm&quot;)) direction = \"reverse\" also works for other annotation functions which have axes, but it is more commonly used for barplot annotations. 3.9 Boxplot annotation Boxplot annotation as well as the annotation functions which are introduced later are more suitable for small matrice. I don’t think you want to put boxplots as column annotation for a matrix with 100 columns. For anno_boxplot(), the input data variable should be a matrix or a list. If x is a matrix and if it is a column annotation, statistics for boxplots are calculated by columns, and if it is a row annotation, the calculation is done by rows. set.seed(12345) m = matrix(rnorm(100), 10) ha = HeatmapAnnotation(foo = anno_boxplot(m, height = unit(4, &quot;cm&quot;))) Graphic parameters are controlled by gp. ha = HeatmapAnnotation(foo = anno_boxplot(m, height = unit(4, &quot;cm&quot;), gp = gpar(fill = 1:10))) Width of the boxes are controlled by box_width. outline controls whether to show outlier points. ha = HeatmapAnnotation(foo = anno_boxplot(m, height = unit(4, &quot;cm&quot;), box_width = 0.9, outline = FALSE)) anno_boxplot() only draws one boxplot for one single row. Section 9.6 demonstrates how to define an annotation function which draws multiple boxplots for a single row, and Section 3.17 demonstrates how to draw one single boxplot for a group of rows. 3.10 Histogram annotation Annotations as histograms are more suitable to put as row annotations. The setting for the data variable is the same as anno_boxplot() which can be a matrix or a list. Similar as anno_boxplot(), the input data variable should be a matrix or a list. If x is a matrix and if it is a column annotation, histograms are calculated by columns, and if it is a row annotation, histograms are calculated by rows. m = matrix(rnorm(1000), nc = 100) ha = rowAnnotation(foo = anno_histogram(m)) # apply `m` on rows Number of breaks for histograms is controlled by n_breaks. ha = rowAnnotation(foo = anno_histogram(m, n_breaks = 20)) Colors are controlled by gp. ha = rowAnnotation(foo = anno_histogram(m, gp = gpar(fill = 1:10))) 3.11 Density annotation Similar as histogram annotations, anno_density() shows the distribution as a fitted curve. ha = rowAnnotation(foo = anno_density(m)) The height of the density peaks can be controlled to make the distribution look like a “joyplot”. ha = rowAnnotation(foo = anno_density(m, joyplot_scale = 2, gp = gpar(fill = &quot;#CCCCCC80&quot;))) Or visualize the distribution as violin plot. ha = rowAnnotation(foo = anno_density(m, type = &quot;violin&quot;, gp = gpar(fill = 1:10))) When there are too many rows in the input variable, the space for normal density peaks might be too small. In this case, we can visualize the distribution by heatmaps. m2 = matrix(rnorm(50*10), nrow = 50) ha = rowAnnotation(foo = anno_density(m2, type = &quot;heatmap&quot;, width = unit(6, &quot;cm&quot;))) THe color schema for heatmap distribution is controlled by heatmap_colors. ha = rowAnnotation(foo = anno_density(m2, type = &quot;heatmap&quot;, width = unit(6, &quot;cm&quot;), heatmap_colors = c(&quot;white&quot;, &quot;orange&quot;))) In ComplexHeatmap package, there is a densityHeatmap() function which visualizes distribution as a heatmap. It will be introduced in Section 10.1. 3.12 Joyplot annotation anno_joyplot() is specific for so-called joyplot (http://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/2017/07/joyplots.html). The input data should be a matrix or a list. Note anno_joyplot() is always applied to columns if the input is a matrix. Because joyplot visualizes parallel distributions and the matrix is not a necessary format while a list is already enough for it, if you are not sure about how to set as a matrix, just convert it to a list for using it. m = matrix(rnorm(1000), nc = 10) lt = apply(m, 2, function(x) data.frame(density(x)[c(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;)])) ha = rowAnnotation(foo = anno_joyplot(lt, width = unit(4, &quot;cm&quot;), gp = gpar(fill = 1:10), transparency = 0.75)) Or only show the lines (scale argument controls the relative height of the curves). m = matrix(rnorm(5000), nc = 50) lt = apply(m, 2, function(x) data.frame(density(x)[c(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;)])) ha = rowAnnotation(foo = anno_joyplot(lt, width = unit(4, &quot;cm&quot;), gp = gpar(fill = NA), scale = 4)) The format of the input variable is special. It can be one of the following two: a matrix (remember anno_joyplot() is always applied to columns of the matrix) where x coordinate corresponds to 1:nrow(matrix) and each column in the matrix corresponds to one distribution in the joyplot. a list of data frames where each data frame has two columns which correspond to x coordinate and y coordinate. 3.13 Horizon chart annotation Horizon chart as annotation can only be added as row annotation. The format of the input variable for anno_horizon() is the same as anno_joyplot() which is introduced in previous section. The default style of horizon chart annotation is: lt = lapply(1:20, function(x) cumprod(1 + runif(1000, -x/100, x/100)) - 1) ha = rowAnnotation(foo = anno_horizon(lt)) Values in each track are normalized by x/max(abs(x)). Colors for positive values and negative values are controlled by pos_fill and neg_fill in gpar(). ha = rowAnnotation(foo = anno_horizon(lt, gp = gpar(pos_fill = &quot;orange&quot;, neg_fill = &quot;darkgreen&quot;))) pos_fill and neg_fill can be assigned as a vector. ha = rowAnnotation(foo = anno_horizon(lt, gp = gpar(pos_fill = rep(c(&quot;orange&quot;, &quot;red&quot;), each = 10), neg_fill = rep(c(&quot;darkgreen&quot;, &quot;blue&quot;), each = 10)))) Whether the peaks for negative values start from the bottom or from the top. ha = rowAnnotation(foo = anno_horizon(lt, negative_from_top = TRUE)) The space between every two neighbouring charts. ha = rowAnnotation(foo = anno_horizon(lt, gap = unit(1, &quot;mm&quot;))) 3.14 Text annotation Text can be used as annotations by anno_text(). Graphic parameters are controlled by gp. ha = rowAnnotation(foo = anno_text(month.name, gp = gpar(fontsize = 1:12+4))) Locationsn are controlled by location and just. Rotation is controlled by rot. ha = rowAnnotation(foo = anno_text(month.name, location = 1, rot = 30, just = &quot;right&quot;, gp = gpar(fontsize = 1:12+4))) ha = rowAnnotation(foo = anno_text(month.name, location = 0.5, just = &quot;center&quot;)) location and just are automatically calculated according the the position of the annotations put to the heatmap (e.g. text are aligned to the left if it is a right annotation to the heatmap and are aligned to the right it it is a left annotation). The width/height are automatically calculated based on all the text. Normally you don’t need to manually set the width/height of it. Background colors can be set by gp. Here fill controls the filled background color, col controls the color of text and the non-standard border controls the background border color. You can see we explicitly set width as 1.2 times the width of the longest text. ha = rowAnnotation(foo = anno_text(month.name, location = 0.5, just = &quot;center&quot;, gp = gpar(fill = rep(2:4, each = 4), col = &quot;white&quot;, border = &quot;black&quot;), width = max_text_width(month.name)*1.2)) 3.15 Mark annotation Sometimes there are many rows or columns in the heatmap and we want to mark some of them. anno_mark() is used to mark subset of rows or columns and connect to labels with lines. anno_mark() at least needs two arguments where at are the indices to the original matrix and labels are the corresponding text. m = matrix(rnorm(1000), nrow = 100) ha = rowAnnotation(foo = anno_mark(at = c(1:4, 20, 60, 97:100), labels = month.name[1:10])) Heatmap(m, name = &quot;mat&quot;, cluster_rows = FALSE, right_annotation = ha) 3.16 Summary annotation There is one special annotation anno_summary() which only works with one-column heatmap or one-row heatmap (we can say the heatmap only contains a vector). It shows summary statistics for the vector in the heatmap. If the corresponding vector is discrete, the summary annotation is presented as barplots and if the vector is continuous, the summary annotation is boxplot. anno_summary() is always used when the heatmap is split so that statistics can be compared between heatmap slices. The first example shows the summary annotation for discrete heatmap. The barplot shows the proportion of each level in each slice. The absolute values can already be seen by the height of the heatmap slice. The color schema for the barplots is automatically extracted from the heatmap. ha = HeatmapAnnotation(summary = anno_summary(height = unit(4, &quot;cm&quot;))) v = sample(letters[1:2], 50, replace = TRUE) split = sample(letters[1:2], 50, replace = TRUE) Heatmap(v, name = &quot;mat&quot;, col = c(&quot;a&quot; = &quot;red&quot;, &quot;b&quot; = &quot;blue&quot;), top_annotation = ha, width = unit(2, &quot;cm&quot;), row_split = split) The second example shows the summary annotation for continuous heatmap. The graphic parameters should be manually set by gp. The legend of the boxplot can be created and added as introduced in Section 5.2, last second paragraph. ha = HeatmapAnnotation(summary = anno_summary(gp = gpar(fill = 2:3), height = unit(4, &quot;cm&quot;))) v = rnorm(50) Heatmap(v, name = &quot;mat&quot;, top_annotation = ha, width = unit(2, &quot;cm&quot;), row_split = split) Normally we don’t draw this one-column heatmap along. It is always combined with other “main heatmaps”. E.g. A gene expression matrix with a one-column heatmap which shows whether the gene is a protein coding gene or a linc-RNA gene. In following, we show a simple example of a “main heatmap” with two one-column heatmaps. The functionality of heatmap concatenation will be introduced in Chapter 4. m = matrix(rnorm(50*10), nrow = 50) ht_list = Heatmap(m, name = &quot;main_matrix&quot;) ha = HeatmapAnnotation(summary = anno_summary(height = unit(3, &quot;cm&quot;))) v = sample(letters[1:2], 50, replace = TRUE) ht_list = ht_list + Heatmap(v, name = &quot;mat1&quot;, top_annotation = ha, width = unit(1, &quot;cm&quot;)) ha = HeatmapAnnotation(summary = anno_summary(gp = gpar(fill = 2:3), height = unit(3, &quot;cm&quot;))) v = rnorm(50) ht_list = ht_list + Heatmap(v, name = &quot;mat2&quot;, top_annotation = ha, width = unit(1, &quot;cm&quot;)) split = sample(letters[1:2], 50, replace = TRUE) lgd_boxplot = Legend(labels = c(&quot;group a&quot;, &quot;group b&quot;), title = &quot;group&quot;, legend_gp = gpar(fill = c(&quot;red&quot;, &quot;blue&quot;))) draw(ht_list, row_split = split, ht_gap = unit(5, &quot;mm&quot;), heatmap_legend_list = list(lgd_boxplot)) 3.17 Zoom/link annotation It is very common scenario that we want to annotate subsets of rows/columns in the heatmap. anno_zoom() helps to create plotting regions that correspond to the original subsets of rows/columns in the heatmap. Since the height/width are usually different from that from the orignal subsets in the heatmap, these plotting regions created by anno_zoom() can be thought as “zoomings” of the original heatmap. Let’s see following example where we make boxplot for each row group. set.seed(123) m = matrix(rnorm(100*10), nrow = 100) subgroup = sample(letters[1:3], 100, replace = TRUE, prob = c(1, 5, 10)) rg = range(m) panel_fun = function(index, nm) { pushViewport(viewport(xscale = rg, yscale = c(0, 2))) grid.rect() grid.xaxis(gp = gpar(fontsize = 8)) grid.boxplot(m[index, ], pos = 1, direction = &quot;horizontal&quot;) popViewport() } anno = anno_zoom(align_to = subgroup, which = &quot;row&quot;, panel_fun = panel_fun, size = unit(2, &quot;cm&quot;), gap = unit(1, &quot;cm&quot;), width = unit(4, &quot;cm&quot;)) Heatmap(m, name = &quot;mat&quot;, right_annotation = rowAnnotation(foo = anno), row_split = subgroup) The important arguments for anno_zoom() are: align_to: It defines how the plotting regions (or the boxes) correspond to the rows or the columns in the heatmap. If the value is a list of indices, each box corresponds to the rows or columns with indices in one vector in the list. If the value is a categorical variable (e.g. a factor or a character vector) that has the same length as the rows or columns in the heatmap, each box corresponds to the rows/columns in each level in the categorical variable. panel_fun: A self-defined function that defines how to draw graphics in the box. The function must have a index argument which is the indices for the rows/columns that the box corresponds to. It can have a second argument nm which is the “name” of the selected part in the heatmap. The corresponding value for nm comes from align_to if it is specified as a categorical variable or a list with names. size: The size of boxes. It can be pure numeric that they are treated as relative fractions of the total height/width of the heatmap. The value of size can also be absolute units. gap: Gaps between boxes. It should be a unit object. anno_zoom() also works for column annotations. In previous example, box plots in the “zoom annotation” use the same data as in the heatmap (they share using the same values in the matrix). In some other cases, the annotations do not have very strong relations to the matrix, except the information of which rows from the matrix. In this case, the functionality is more proper to be understanded as to provide linking between subsets of rows and a list of graphic regions. Thus, there is an anno_link() function which is basically the same as anno_zoom(). The two functions are exactly the same, just with different names, depends how you understand. An example of using anno_link() is to correspond a list of text to a subset of rows, see examples from https://github.com/jokergoo/simplifyEnrichment. 3.18 Multiple annotations As mentioned before, to put multiple annotations in HeatmapAnnotation(), they just need to be specified as name-value pairs. In HeatmapAnnotation(), there are some arguments which controls multiple annotations. For these arguments, they are specified as a vector which has same length as number of the annotations, or a named vector with subset of the annotations. The simple annotations which are specified as vectors, matrices and data frames will automatically have legends on the heatmap. show_legend controls whether to draw the legends for them. Note here if show_legend is a vector, the value of show_legend should be in one of the following formats: A logical vector with the same length as the number of simple annotations. A logical vector with the same length as the number of totla annotations. The values for complex annotations are ignored. A named vector to control subset of the simple annotations. For customization on the annotation legends, please refer to Section 5.4. ha = HeatmapAnnotation(foo = 1:10, bar = cbind(1:10, 10:1), pt = anno_points(1:10), show_legend = c(&quot;bar&quot; = FALSE) ) Heatmap(matrix(rnorm(100), 10), name = &quot;mat&quot;, top_annotation = ha) gp controls graphic parameters (except fill) for the simple annotatios, such as the border of annotation grids. ha = HeatmapAnnotation(foo = 1:10, bar = cbind(1:10, 10:1), pt = anno_points(1:10), gp = gpar(col = &quot;red&quot;) ) border controls the border of every single annotations. show_annotation_name controls whether show annotation names. As mentioned, the value can be a single value, a vector or a named vector. ha = HeatmapAnnotation(foo = 1:10, bar = cbind(1:10, 10:1), pt = anno_points(1:10), show_annotation_name = c(bar = FALSE), # only turn off `bar` border = c(foo = TRUE) # turn on foo ) annotation_name_gp, annotation_name_offset, annotation_name_side and annotation_name_rot control the style and position of the annotation names. The latter three can be specified as named vectors. If annotation_name_offset is specified as a named vector, it can be specified as characters while not unit objects: annotation_name_offset = c(foo = \"1cm\"). gap controls the space between every two neighbouring annotations. The value can be a single unit or a vector of units. ha = HeatmapAnnotation(foo = 1:10, bar = cbind(1:10, 10:1), pt = anno_points(1:10), gap = unit(2, &quot;mm&quot;)) ha = HeatmapAnnotation(foo = 1:10, bar = cbind(1:10, 10:1), pt = anno_points(1:10), gap = unit(c(2, 10), &quot;mm&quot;)) 3.18.1 Size of annotations height, width, annotation_height and annotation_width control the height or width of the complete heatmap annotations. Normally you don’t need to set them because all the single annotations have fixed height/width and the final height/width for the whole heatmap annotation is the sum of them. Resizing these values will involve rather complicated adjustment depending on whether it is a simple annotation or complex annotation. The resizing of heatmap annotations will also happen when adjusting a list of heatmaps. In following examples, we take column annotations as examples and demonstrate some scenarios for the resizing adjustment. First the default height of ha: # foo: 1cm, bar: 5mm, pt: 1cm ha = HeatmapAnnotation(foo = cbind(1:10, 10:1), bar = 1:10, pt = anno_points(1:10)) If height is set, the size of the simple annotation will not change, while only the complex annotations are adjusted. If there are multiple complex annotations, they are adjusted according to the ratio of their original size. # foo: 1cm, bar: 5mm, pt: 4.5cm ha = HeatmapAnnotation(foo = cbind(1:10, 10:1), bar = 1:10, pt = anno_points(1:10), height = unit(6, &quot;cm&quot;)) simple_anno_size controls the height of all simple annotations. Recall ht_opt$simple_anno_size can be set to globally control the size of simple annotations in all heatmaps. # foo: 2cm, bar:1cm, pt: 3cm ha = HeatmapAnnotation(foo = cbind(1:10, 10:1), bar = 1:10, pt = anno_points(1:10), simple_anno_size = unit(1, &quot;cm&quot;), height = unit(6, &quot;cm&quot;)) If annotation_height is set as a vector of absolute units, the height of all three annotations are adjusted accordingly. # foo: 1cm, bar: 2cm, pt: 3cm ha = HeatmapAnnotation(foo = cbind(1:10, 10:1), bar = 1:10, pt = anno_points(1:10), annotation_height = unit(1:3, &quot;cm&quot;)) If annotation_height is set as pure numbers which is treated as relative ratios for annotations, height should also be set as an absolute unit and the size of every single annotation is adjusted by the ratios. # foo: 1cm, bar: 2cm, pt: 3cm ha = HeatmapAnnotation(foo = cbind(1:10, 10:1), bar = 1:10, pt = anno_points(1:10), annotation_height = 1:3, height = unit(6, &quot;cm&quot;)) annotation_height can be mixed with relative units (in null unit) and absolute units. # foo: 1.5cm, bar: 1.5cm, pt: 3cm ha = HeatmapAnnotation(foo = cbind(1:10, 10:1), bar = 1:10, pt = anno_points(1:10), annotation_height = unit(c(1, 1, 3), c(&quot;null&quot;, &quot;null&quot;, &quot;cm&quot;)), height = unit(6, &quot;cm&quot;) ) # foo: 2cm, bar: 1cm, pt: 3cm ha = HeatmapAnnotation(foo = cbind(1:10, 10:1), bar = 1:10, pt = anno_points(1:10), annotation_height = unit(c(2, 1, 3), c(&quot;cm&quot;, &quot;null&quot;, &quot;cm&quot;)), height = unit(6, &quot;cm&quot;) ) If there are only simple annotations, simply setting height won’t change the height. # foo: 1cm, bar: 5mm ha = HeatmapAnnotation(foo = cbind(1:10, 10:1), bar = 1:10, height = unit(6, &quot;cm&quot;)) unless simple_anno_size_adjust is set to TRUE. # foo: 4cm, bar: 2cm ha = HeatmapAnnotation(foo = cbind(1:10, 10:1), bar = 1:10, height = unit(6, &quot;cm&quot;), simple_anno_size_adjust = TRUE) Section 4.6 introduces how the annotation sizes are adjusted among a list of heatmaps. 3.18.2 Annotation labels From version 2.3.3, alternative labels for annotations can be set by annotation_label argument: ha = HeatmapAnnotation(foo = 1:10, bar = cbind(1:10, 10:1), pt = anno_points(1:10), annotation_label = c(&quot;Annotation_foo&quot;, &quot;Annotation_bar&quot;, &quot;Annotation_pt&quot;) ) Heatmap(matrix(rnorm(100), 10), name = &quot;mat&quot;, top_annotation = ha) 3.19 Utility functions There are some utility functions which make the manipulation of heatmap annotation easier. Just see following examples. ha = HeatmapAnnotation(foo = 1:10, bar = cbind(1:10, 10:1), pt = anno_points(1:10)) length(ha) ## [1] 3 nobs(ha) ## [1] 10 Get or set the names of the annotations: names(ha) ## [1] &quot;foo&quot; &quot;bar&quot; &quot;pt&quot; names(ha) = c(&quot;FOO&quot;, &quot;BAR&quot;, &quot;PT&quot;) names(ha) ## [1] &quot;FOO&quot; &quot;BAR&quot; &quot;PT&quot; You can concatenate two HeatmapAnnotation objects if they contain same number of observations and different annotation names. ha1 = HeatmapAnnotation(foo = 1:10, bar = cbind(1:10, 10:1), pt = anno_points(1:10)) ha2 = HeatmapAnnotation(FOO = runif(10), BAR = sample(c(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;), 10, replace = TRUE), PT = anno_points(rnorm(10))) ha = c(ha1, ha2) names(ha) ## [1] &quot;foo&quot; &quot;bar&quot; &quot;pt&quot; &quot;FOO&quot; &quot;BAR&quot; &quot;PT&quot; HeatmapAnnoation object sometimes is subsettable. The row index corresponds to observations in the annotation and column index corresponds to the annotations. If the annotations are all simple annotations or the complex annotation created by anno_*() functions in ComplexHeatmap package, the HeatmapAnnotation object is always subsettable. ha_subset = ha[1:5, c(&quot;foo&quot;, &quot;PT&quot;)] ha_subset ## A HeatmapAnnotation object with 2 annotations ## name: heatmap_annotation_96 ## position: column ## items: 5 ## width: 1npc ## height: 15.3514598035146mm ## this object is subsetable ## 5.21733333333333mm extension on the left ## 6.75733333333333mm extension on the right ## ## name annotation_type color_mapping height ## foo continuous vector random 5mm ## PT anno_points() 10mm 3.20 Implement new annotation functions All the annotation functions defined in ComplexHeatmap are constructed by the AnnotationFunction class. The AnnotationFunction class not only stores the “real R function” which draws the graphics, it also calculates the spaces caused by the annotation axis, more importantly, it allows splitting the annotation graphics according to the split of the main heatmap. As expected, the main part of the AnnotationFunction class is a function which defines how to draw at specific positions which correspond to rows or columns in the heatmap. The function should have three arguments: index, k and n (the names of the arguments can be arbitrary) where k and n are optional. index corresponds to the indices of rows or columns of the heatmap. The value of index is not necessarily to be the whole row indices or column indices in the heatmap. It can also be a subset of the indices if the annotation is split into slices according to the split of the heatmap. index is reordered according to the reordering of heatmap rows or columns (e.g. by clustering). So, index actually contains a list of row or column indices for the current slice after row or column reordering. As mentioned, annotation can be split into slices. k corresponds to the current slice and n corresponds to the total number of slices. The annotation function draws in every slice repeatedly. The information of k and n sometimes can be useful, for example, we want to add axis in the annotation, and if it is a column annotation and axis is drawn on the very right of the annotation area, the axis is only drawn when k == n. Since the function only allows index, k and n, the function sometimes uses several external variables which can not be defined inside the function, e.g. the data points for the annotation. These variables should be imported into the AnnotationFunction class by var_import so that the function can correctly find these variables. One important feature for AnnotationFunction class is it can be subsetable, which is the base for splitting. To allow subsetting of the object, users need to define the rule for the imported variables if there is any. The rules are simple functions which accpet the variable and indices, and return the subset of the variable. The subset rule functions implemented in this package are subset_gp(), subset_matrix_by_row() and subset_vector(). If the subsetting rule is not provided, it is inferred by the type of the object. We first construct an AnnotationFunction object which needs external variable and supports subsetting. x = 1:10 anno1 = AnnotationFunction( fun = function(index, k, n) { n = length(index) pushViewport(viewport(xscale = c(0.5, n + 0.5), yscale = c(0, 10))) grid.rect() grid.points(1:n, x[index], default.units = &quot;native&quot;) if(k == 1) grid.yaxis() popViewport() }, var_import = list(x = x), n = 10, subsetable = TRUE, height = unit(2, &quot;cm&quot;) ) anno1 ## An AnnotationFunction object ## function: user-defined ## position: column ## items: 10 ## width: 1npc ## height: 2cm ## imported variable: x ## this object is subsetable Then we can assign anno1 in HeatmapAnnotation() function. Since anno1 is subsettable, you can split columns of the heatmap. m = rbind(1:10, 11:20) Heatmap(m, top_annotation = HeatmapAnnotation(foo = anno1)) Heatmap(m, top_annotation = HeatmapAnnotation(foo = anno1), column_split = rep(c(&quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;), each = 5)) The second way is to put all data variables inside the function and no need to import other variables. # code only for demonstration anno2 = AnnotationFunction( fun = function(index) { x = 1:10 n = length(index) pushViewport(viewport()) grid.points(1:n, x[index]) popViewport() }, n = 10, subsetable = TRUE ) The most compact way to only specify the function to the constructor. # code only for demonstration anno3 = AnnotationFunction( fun = function(index) { x = 1:10 n = length(index) pushViewport(viewport()) grid.points(1:n, x[index]) popViewport() } ) All the anno_*() functions introduced in this section actually are not really annotation functions, while they are functions generating annotation functions with specific configurations. However, users don’t need to be that aware of. anno_points(1:10) ## An AnnotationFunction object ## function: anno_points() ## position: column ## items: 10 ## width: 1npc ## height: 1cm ## imported variable: data_scale, axis_param, border, size, value, pch_as_image, axis, gp, axis_grob, pch ## subsetable variable: gp, value, size, pch ## this object is subsetable ## 5.13831111111111mm extension on the left In most cases, you don’t need to manually construct your AnnotationFunction objects. The annotation function anno_*() implemented in ComplexHeatmap are already enough for most of the analysis tasks. On the other hand, users can also use anno_empty() and decorate_annotation() to quickly add self-defined annotation graphics. E.g. we can re-implement previous heatmap as: ht = Heatmap(m, top_annotation = HeatmapAnnotation(foo = anno_empty(height = unit(2, &quot;cm&quot;))), column_split = rep(c(&quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;), each = 5)) ht = draw(ht) co = column_order(ht) decorate_annotation(&quot;foo&quot;, slice = 1, { od = co[[1]] pushViewport(viewport(xscale = c(0.5, length(od) + 0.5), yscale = range(x))) grid.points(seq_along(od), x[od]) grid.yaxis() popViewport() }) decorate_annotation(&quot;foo&quot;, slice = 2, { od = co[[2]] pushViewport(viewport(xscale = c(0.5, length(od) + 0.5), yscale = range(x))) grid.points(seq_along(od), x[od]) popViewport() }) "],

In this chapter, we mainly introduce the horizontal concatenation because this is the major case we will use in the analysis. In the end we show some examples of vertical concatenation. The concept behind for horizontal and vertical concatenation basically is similar. For the horizontal concatenation, the number of rows for all heatmaps and annotations should be the same. In following we first introduce the concatenation of heatmaps and later we will show how to concatenate heatmaps with annotations. In following example, there are three matrices where the third heatmap is a vector and it will be transformed as a one-column matrix. The one-column heatmap is sometimes useful when you concatenate a list of heatmaps that it can show e.g. annotations for each row or some scores of each row. E.g. if rows are genes, the type of the genes (i.e. protein coding or not) can be represented as a one-column character matrix, and the p-value or the fold change from differential expression analysis can be represented as a one-column numeric matrix, and be concatenated to the main expression heatmap. set.seed(123) mat1 = matrix(rnorm(80, 2), 8, 10) mat1 = rbind(mat1, matrix(rnorm(40, -2), 4, 10)) rownames(mat1) = paste0(&quot;R&quot;, 1:12) colnames(mat1) = paste0(&quot;C&quot;, 1:10) mat2 = matrix(runif(60, max = 3, min = 1), 6, 10) mat2 = rbind(mat2, matrix(runif(60, max = 2, min = 0), 6, 10)) rownames(mat2) = paste0(&quot;R&quot;, 1:12) colnames(mat2) = paste0(&quot;C&quot;, 1:10) le = sample(letters[1:3], 12, replace = TRUE) names(le) = paste0(&quot;R&quot;, 1:12) ind = sample(12, 12) mat1 = mat1[ind, ] mat2 = mat2[ind, ] le = le[ind] To concatenate heatmaps, simply use + operator. ht1 = Heatmap(mat1, name = &quot;rnorm&quot;) ht2 = Heatmap(mat2, name = &quot;runif&quot;) ht3 = Heatmap(le, name = &quot;letters&quot;) ht1 + ht2 + ht3 Under default mode, dendrograms from the second heatmap will be removed and row orders will be the same as the first one. Also row names for the first two heatmaps are removed as well. The returned value of the concatenation is a HeatmapList object. Similar as explained in Section 2.11, directly printing ht_list will call draw() method with default settings. With explicitly calling draw() method, you can have more controls on the heatmap list. ht_list = ht1 + ht2 + ht3 class(ht_list) ## [1] &quot;HeatmapList&quot; ## attr(,&quot;package&quot;) ## [1] &quot;ComplexHeatmap&quot; You can append any number of heatmaps to the heatmap list. Also you can append a heatmap list to a heatmap list. # code only for demonstration ht1 + ht_list ht_list + ht1 ht_list + ht_list NULL can be added to the heatmap list. It would be convinient when users want to construct a heatmap list through a for loop. # code only for demonstration ht_list = NULL ## Heatmap(...) + NULL gives you a HeatmapList object for(s in sth) { ht_list = ht_list + Heatmap(...) } You can also add heatmap annotations to the heatmap list, see more details in Section 4.7. 4.1 Titles A heatmap list also has title which is like a global title covering all heatmaps. row_title and column_title should be set in the draw() function. From following example, we set different colors for each heatmap to make them distinguishable. col_rnorm = colorRamp2(c(-3, 0, 3), c(&quot;green&quot;, &quot;white&quot;, &quot;red&quot;)) col_runif = colorRamp2(c(0, 3), c(&quot;white&quot;, &quot;orange&quot;)) col_letters = c(&quot;a&quot; = &quot;pink&quot;, &quot;b&quot; = &quot;purple&quot;, &quot;c&quot; = &quot;blue&quot;) ht1 = Heatmap(mat1, name = &quot;rnorm&quot;, col = col_rnorm, row_title = &quot;Heatmap 1&quot;, column_title = &quot;Heatmap 1&quot;) ht2 = Heatmap(mat2, name = &quot;runif&quot;, col = col_runif, row_title = &quot;Heatmap 2&quot;, column_title = &quot;Heatmap 2&quot;) ht3 = Heatmap(le, name = &quot;letters&quot;, col = col_letters) ht_list = ht1 + ht2 + ht3 draw(ht_list, row_title = &quot;Three heatmaps, row title&quot;, row_title_gp = gpar(col = &quot;red&quot;), column_title = &quot;Three heatmaps, column title&quot;, column_title_gp = gpar(fontsize = 16)) 4.2 Size of heatmaps The width for some heatmaps can be set to absolute units. Note width controls the width of the heatmap body. ht2 = Heatmap(mat2, name = &quot;runif&quot;, col = col_runif, width = unit(4, &quot;cm&quot;)) ht3 = Heatmap(le, name = &quot;letters&quot;, col = col_letters, width = unit(5, &quot;mm&quot;)) ht1 + ht2 + ht3 The width of all heatmaps can be set as absolute units. ht1 = Heatmap(mat1, name = &quot;rnorm&quot;, col = col_rnorm, width = unit(4, &quot;cm&quot;)) ht2 = Heatmap(mat2, name = &quot;runif&quot;, col = col_runif, width = unit(6, &quot;cm&quot;)) ht3 = Heatmap(le, name = &quot;letters&quot;, col = col_letters, width = unit(1, &quot;cm&quot;)) ht1 + ht2 + ht3 If width is numeric, it is converted as a null unit. ht1 = Heatmap(mat1, name = &quot;rnorm&quot;, col = col_rnorm, width = 6) ht2 = Heatmap(mat2, name = &quot;runif&quot;, col = col_runif, width = 4) ht3 = Heatmap(le, name = &quot;letters&quot;, col = col_letters, width = 1) ht1 + ht2 + ht3 heatmap_width also can control the width of the heatmap, but it is the total width of the heatmap body plus the heatmap components. 4.3 Gap between heatmaps ht_gap controls the space between heatmaps. The value can be a single unit or a vector of units. ht1 = Heatmap(mat1, name = &quot;rnorm&quot;, col = col_rnorm) ht2 = Heatmap(mat2, name = &quot;runif&quot;, col = col_runif) ht3 = Heatmap(le, name = &quot;letters&quot;, col = col_letters) ht_list = ht1 + ht2 + ht3 draw(ht_list, ht_gap = unit(1, &quot;cm&quot;)) draw(ht_list, ht_gap = unit(c(3, 10), &quot;mm&quot;)) 4.4 Automatic adjustment to the main heatmap There is always a main heatmap in the heatmap list that controls the global row ordering. All the other heatmaps are automatically adjusted according to the settings in the main heatmap. For these non-main heatmaps, the adjustments are: No row clustering is performed and they all take the row ordering of the main heatmap. Row titles are removed. If the main heatmap is split by rows, all other heatmaps will also be split by same levels as the main heatmap. The height of the main heatmap are taken as the height of all heatmaps. By default, the first heatmap is taken as the main heatmap. ht1 = Heatmap(mat1, name = &quot;rnorm&quot;, col = col_rnorm, row_km = 2) ht2 = Heatmap(mat2, name = &quot;runif&quot;, col = col_runif) ht3 = Heatmap(le, name = &quot;letters&quot;, col = col_letters) ht2 + ht1 + ht3 # ht2 is the main heatmap and row_km in ht1 is ignored The main heatmap can be specified by main_heatmap argument. The value can be a numeric index or the name of the heatmap (of course, you need to set the heatmap name when you create the Heatmap object). In following example, although ht1 is the second heatmap, we can set it as the main heatmap. ht_list = ht2 + ht1 + ht3 draw(ht_list, main_heatmap = &quot;rnorm&quot;) By default, the dendrogram and the row title are plotted just beside the main heatmap, just to emphasize the clustering or the splitting is calculated from the main heatmap while not other heatmaps. However, the position of the dendrogram and row title of the main heatmap can be controlled by row_dend_side and row_sub_title_side in draw() function. ht_list = ht2 + ht1 + ht3 draw(ht_list, main_heatmap = &quot;rnorm&quot;, row_dend_side = &quot;right&quot;, row_sub_title_side = &quot;left&quot;) Similarly, if there is no row clustering in the main heatmap, all other heatmaps are not clustered neither. ht1 = Heatmap(mat1, name = &quot;rnorm&quot;, col = col_rnorm, cluster_rows = FALSE) ht2 = Heatmap(mat2, name = &quot;runif&quot;, col = col_runif) ht3 = Heatmap(le, name = &quot;letters&quot;, col = col_letters) ht1 + ht2 + ht3 As you may have observed, all the row names between heatmaps are removed from the plot. You can show them by setting auto_adjust = FALSE. ht1 = Heatmap(mat1, name = &quot;rnorm&quot;, col = col_rnorm) ht2 = Heatmap(mat2, name = &quot;runif&quot;, col = col_runif) ht3 = Heatmap(le, name = &quot;letters&quot;, col = col_letters) ht_list = ht1 + ht2 + ht3 draw(ht_list, auto_adjust = FALSE) 4.5 Control main heatmap in draw() function Settings of the main heatmap can be controlled in the main Heatmap() function. To make it convinient, settings that affect heatmap rows can also be directly set in draw(). If some of these settings are set, corresponding settings in the main Heatmap() will be overwritten. In draw() function, following main heatmap settings control row orders of all heatmaps. cluster_rows clustering_distance_rows clustering_method_rows row_dend_width show_row_dend row_dend_reorder row_dend_gp row_order Following settings control the row slices. row_gap row_km row_km_repeats row_split Following settings control the heatmap height. height heatmap_height In following example, row_km = 2, cluster_rows = FALSE for ht1 is overwritten in draw(). ht1 = Heatmap(mat1, name = &quot;rnorm&quot;, col = col_rnorm, row_km = 2, cluster_rows = FALSE) ht2 = Heatmap(mat2, name = &quot;runif&quot;, col = col_runif) ht3 = Heatmap(le, name = &quot;letters&quot;, col = col_letters) ht_list = ht1 + ht2 + ht3 draw(ht_list, row_km = 1, row_split = le, cluster_rows = TRUE) 4.6 Annotations as components are adjusted If some of the heatmaps in the heatmap list have annotations, in most of the cases, the heights of the heatmap annotations are different for different heatmaps. There are automatic adjustment for heatmap annotations, and this adjustment will also involve adjustment of dendrograms. Normally, the size of simple annotations will not change in the adjustment. In following example, the dendrogram for the second heatmap is adjusted. Note you still can change the size of simple annotation by setting anno_simple_size in HeatmapAnnotation() or globally set ht_opt$anno_simple_size. ha1 = HeatmapAnnotation(foo1 = 1:10, annotation_name_side = &quot;left&quot;) ht1 = Heatmap(mat1, name = &quot;rnorm&quot;, col = col_rnorm, top_annotation = ha1) ht2 = Heatmap(mat2, name = &quot;runif&quot;, col = col_runif) ht3 = Heatmap(le, name = &quot;letters&quot;, col = col_letters) ht1 + ht2 + ht3 If the first two heatmaps all have annotations, since the size of simple annotations keep unchanged, the size of complex annotations will be adjusted to make the total heights of the two heatmap annotations the same. ha1 = HeatmapAnnotation(foo1 = 1:10, bar1 = anno_points(1:10), annotation_name_side = &quot;left&quot;) ha2 = HeatmapAnnotation(bar2 = anno_barplot(1:10)) ht1 = Heatmap(mat1, name = &quot;rnorm&quot;, col = col_rnorm, top_annotation = ha1) ht2 = Heatmap(mat2, name = &quot;runif&quot;, col = col_runif, top_annotation = ha2) ht3 = Heatmap(le, name = &quot;letters&quot;, col = col_letters) ht_list = ht1 + ht2 + ht3 draw(ht_list, ht_gap = unit(c(6, 2), &quot;mm&quot;)) Similarly, if the first heatmap only contains simple annotatins, dendrogram will be adjusted. ha1 = HeatmapAnnotation(foo1 = 1:10, annotation_name_side = &quot;left&quot;) ha2 = HeatmapAnnotation(bar2 = anno_barplot(1:10, height = unit(2, &quot;cm&quot;))) ht1 = Heatmap(mat1, name = &quot;rnorm&quot;, col = col_rnorm, top_annotation = ha1) ht2 = Heatmap(mat2, name = &quot;runif&quot;, col = col_runif, top_annotation = ha2) ht3 = Heatmap(le, name = &quot;letters&quot;, col = col_letters) ht_list = ht1 + ht2 + ht3 draw(ht_list, ht_gap = unit(c(6, 2), &quot;mm&quot;)) If the both heatmaps only contain simple annotations but with unequal number, dendrogram will be adjusted. ha1 = HeatmapAnnotation(foo1 = 1:10, annotation_name_side = &quot;left&quot;) ha2 = HeatmapAnnotation(bar2 = cbind(b1 = 1:10, b2 = 11:20, b3 = 21:30)) ht1 = Heatmap(mat1, name = &quot;rnorm&quot;, col = col_rnorm, top_annotation = ha1) ht2 = Heatmap(mat2, name = &quot;runif&quot;, col = col_runif, top_annotation = ha2) ht3 = Heatmap(le, name = &quot;letters&quot;, col = col_letters) ht_list = ht1 + ht2 + ht3 draw(ht_list) If you also want to automatically adjust the size of simple annotations, set simple_anno_size_adjust = TRUE in every HeatmapAnnotation() calls. If the second heatmap has no bottom annotation, column names for the second heatmap are adjusted to be put directly below the heatmap body. ha1 = HeatmapAnnotation(foo1 = 1:10, bar1 = anno_points(1:10), annotation_name_side = &quot;left&quot;) ht1 = Heatmap(mat1, name = &quot;rnorm&quot;, col = col_rnorm, bottom_annotation = ha1) ht2 = Heatmap(mat2, name = &quot;runif&quot;, col = col_runif) ht3 = Heatmap(le, name = &quot;letters&quot;, col = col_letters) ht_list = ht1 + ht2 + ht3 draw(ht_list) 4.7 Concatenate with annotations Row annotations can be concatenated to the horizontal heatmap list, while not only a component of the heatmap. See following examples which are very straightforward. ha1 = rowAnnotation(foo = 1:12, bar = anno_barplot(1:12, width = unit(4, &quot;cm&quot;))) ht1 = Heatmap(mat1, name = &quot;rnorm&quot;, col = col_rnorm, row_km = 2) ht1 + ha1 The foo and bar annotations can be defined in two separated rowAnnotation() calls. Heatmap(mat1, name = &quot;rnorm&quot;, col = col_rnorm, row_km = 2) + rowAnnotation(foo = 1:12) + rowAnnotation(bar = anno_barplot(1:12, width = unit(4, &quot;cm&quot;))) Basically heatmaps and row annotations can be concatenated arbitarily. rowAnnotation(foo = 1:12) + Heatmap(mat1, name = &quot;rnorm&quot;, col = col_rnorm, row_km = 2) + rowAnnotation(bar = anno_barplot(1:12, width = unit(4, &quot;cm&quot;))) + Heatmap(mat2, name = &quot;runif&quot;, col = col_runif) As mentioned in previous chapters, row annotations can also be heatmap components as left annotations or right annotations. The difference of row annotations as independent ones and as heatmap components is discussed in Section 4.9. 4.8 Concatenate only the annotations The concatenation can be done without any heatmap. rowAnnotation(foo = 1:12) + rowAnnotation(bar = anno_barplot(1:12, width = unit(4, &quot;cm&quot;))) If there is only one HeatmapAnnotation object, you must concatenated with NULL. rowAnnotation(bar = anno_barplot(1:12, width = unit(4, &quot;cm&quot;))) + NULL The annotation list is actually also a HeatmapList object. anno_list = rowAnnotation(foo = 1:12) + rowAnnotation(bar = anno_barplot(1:12, width = unit(4, &quot;cm&quot;))) class(anno_list) ## [1] &quot;HeatmapList&quot; ## attr(,&quot;package&quot;) ## [1] &quot;ComplexHeatmap&quot; Thus, you can use some functionalities of the draw() function for the annotation list, such as row splitting. draw(anno_list, row_split = rep(c(&quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;), each = 6)) In Section 10.2, we will show how to use a list of annotations to visualize multiple summary statistics. 4.9 Vertical concatenation Heatmaps and annotations (now it is column annotation) can be concatenated vertically by the %v% operator. All the relatated settings and adjustments are very similar as the horizontal concatenation. Please check following examples. mat1t = t(mat1) mat2t = t(mat2) ht1 = Heatmap(mat1t, name = &quot;rnorm&quot;, col = col_rnorm, row_title = &quot;rnorm&quot;) ht2 = Heatmap(mat2t, name = &quot;runif&quot;, col = col_runif, row_title = &quot;runif&quot;) ht3 = Heatmap(rbind(letters = le), name = &quot;letters&quot;, col = col_letters) ht_list = ht1 %v% ht2 %v% ht3 draw(ht_list) draw(ht_list, column_km = 2) ha = HeatmapAnnotation(foo = anno_barplot(1:12, height = unit(2, &quot;cm&quot;))) ht_list = ht1 %v% ha %v% ht2 %v% ht3 draw(ht_list, column_km = 2) ht1 = Heatmap(mat1t, name = &quot;rnorm&quot;, col = col_rnorm, row_km = 2) ht2 = Heatmap(mat2t, name = &quot;runif&quot;, col = col_runif, row_km = 2) ht3 = Heatmap(rbind(letters = le), name = &quot;letters&quot;, col = col_letters) ha = HeatmapAnnotation(foo = anno_barplot(1:12, height = unit(2, &quot;cm&quot;))) ht_list = ht1 %v% ha %v% ht2 %v% ht3 draw(ht_list, column_km = 2) For the vertical heatmap list, now row annotations should be the heatmap components (by right_annotation and left_annotation) and they are adjusted just like column annotations for the horizontal heatmap list. ht1 = Heatmap(mat1t, name = &quot;rnorm&quot;, col = col_rnorm, row_km = 2, left_annotation = rowAnnotation(foo1 = 1:10, bar1 = anno_barplot(1:10))) ha = HeatmapAnnotation(foo = anno_barplot(1:12, height = unit(2, &quot;cm&quot;), axis_param = list(side = &quot;right&quot;))) ht2 = Heatmap(mat2t, name = &quot;runif&quot;, col = col_runif, row_km = 2, left_annotation = rowAnnotation(foo2 = 1:10)) ht3 = Heatmap(rbind(letters = le), name = &quot;letters&quot;, col = col_letters) ht_list = ht1 %v% ha %v% ht2 %v% ht3 draw(ht_list, column_km = 2) Since rowAnnotation() allows arbitary number of annotations, the way showed above is the only way to expand the heatmap list horizontally and vertically at the same time. 4.10 Subset the heatmap list Similar as subsetting the Heatmap object (Section 2.13), the heatmap list can also be subsetted by providing row index and column index. For horizontal heatmap list, row index correspond to rows in all heatmaps and annotations, while column index only corresponds to a subset of heatmaps and annotations. For vertical heatmap list, it’s the other way around. In following we use horizontal heatmap list as example. ht1 = Heatmap(mat1, name = &quot;rnorm&quot;, col = col_rnorm, left_annotation = rowAnnotation(foo1 = 1:12, bar1 = anno_points(1:12))) ht2 = Heatmap(mat2, name = &quot;runif&quot;, col = col_runif) ha = rowAnnotation(foo2 = anno_barplot(1:12), bar2 = 12:1) ht_list = ht1 + ht2 + ha names(ht_list) ## [1] &quot;rnorm&quot; &quot;runif&quot; &quot;foo2&quot; &quot;bar2&quot; ht_list[1:6, c(&quot;rnorm&quot;, &quot;bar2&quot;)] foo1 and bar are components of heatmap rnorm, so they can not be selected in the subset function, while foo2 and bar2 are independent row annotations and they can selected to take subset of them. 4.11 Plot the heatmap list Similar as described in Section 2.11, directly entering the HeatmapList object in interactive R session calls the show() method which calls the draw() method internally. When there is no plot after you entering the object, you should use draw() explicitly: # code only for demonstration draw(ht_list, ...) 4.12 Get orders and dendrograms row_order(), column_order(), row_dend() and column_dend() can be used to retrieve corresponding information from the heatmap list. The usage is straightforward by following examples. But remember you need to apply these functions on the object returned by draw(). ht1 = Heatmap(mat1, name = &quot;rnorm&quot;, col = col_rnorm) ht2 = Heatmap(mat2, name = &quot;runif&quot;, col = col_runif) ht_list = ht1 + ht2 ht_list = draw(ht_list) row_order(ht_list) ## [1] 10 4 8 2 1 12 11 6 7 3 9 5 column_order(ht_list) ## $rnorm ## [1] 5 2 7 6 10 1 9 8 4 3 ## ## $runif ## [1] 4 10 2 5 7 6 1 3 8 9 If rows or columns are split, the returned values will also be a list. ht1 = Heatmap(mat1, name = &quot;rnorm&quot;, col = col_rnorm) ht2 = Heatmap(mat2, name = &quot;runif&quot;, col = col_runif, column_km = 2) ht_list = ht1 + ht2 ht_list = draw(ht_list, row_km = 2) row_order(ht_list) ## $`1` ## [1] 7 3 9 5 ## ## $`2` ## [1] 10 4 8 2 1 12 11 6 column_order(ht_list) ## $rnorm ## $rnorm[[1]] ## [1] 5 2 7 6 10 1 9 8 4 3 ## ## ## $runif ## $runif$`1` ## [1] 7 6 1 3 8 9 ## ## $runif$`2` ## [1] 4 10 2 5 You can specify a certain heatmap for the column order. column_order(ht_list, name = &quot;runif&quot;) ## $`1` ## [1] 7 6 1 3 8 9 ## ## $`2` ## [1] 4 10 2 5 The logic is the same for extracting dendrograms and also the same for vertical heatmap list, so we don’t show more examples here. 4.13 Change parameters globally ht_opt() is an option function which controls some parameters globally. You can set some parameters for all heatmaps/annotations simultaneously by this global function. Please note you should put it before your heatmap code and reset all option values after drawing the heatmaps to get rid of affecting next heatmap. ht_opt ## Option Value ## heatmap_row_names_gp NULL ## heatmap_column_names_gp NULL ## heatmap_row_title_gp NULL ## heatmap_column_title_gp NULL ## legend_title_gp NULL ## legend_title_position NULL ## legend_labels_gp NULL ## legend_grid_height NULL ## legend_grid_width NULL ## legend_border NULL ## legend_gap 2mm, 4mm ## heatmap_border NULL ## annotation_border NULL ## fast_hclust FALSE ## show_parent_dend_line TRUE ## verbose FALSE ## message TRUE ## show_vp FALSE ## simple_anno_size 5mm ## DENDROGRAM_PADDING 0.5mm ## DIMNAME_PADDING 1mm ## TITLE_PADDING 2.5mm ## COLUMN_ANNO_PADDING 1mm ## ROW_ANNO_PADDING 1mm ## HEATMAP_LEGEND_PADDING 2mm ## ANNOTATION_LEGEND_PADDING 2mm There are following parameters to control all heatmaps: heatmap_row_names_gp: set row_names_gp in all Heatmap(). heatmap_column_names_gp: set column_names_gp in all Heatmap(). heatmap_row_title_gp: set row_title_gp in all Heatmap(). heatmap_column_title_gp: set column_title_gp in all Heatmap(). heatmap_border: set border in all Heatmap(). Following parameters control the legends: legend_title_gp: set title_gp in all heatmap legends and annotation legends. legend_title_position: set title_position in all heatmap legends and annotation legends. legend_labels_gp: set labels_gp in all heatmap legends and annotation legends. legend_grid_width: set grid_width in all heatmap legends and annotation legends. legend_grid_height: set grid_height in all heatmap legends and annotation legends. legend_border: set border in all heatmap legends and annotation legends. Following parameters control heatmap annotations: annotation_border: set border in all HeatmapAnnotation(). anno_simple_size: set size for the simple annotation. Following parameters control the space between heatmap components: DENDROGRAM_PADDING: space bewteen dendrograms and heatmap body. DIMNAME_PADDING: space between row/column names and heatmap body. TITLE_PADDING: space between row/column titles and heatmap body. COLUMN_ANNO_PADDING: space between column annotations and heatmap body. ROW_ANNO_PADDING: space between row annotations and heatmap body. Other parameters: fast_hclust: whether use fastcluster::hclust() to speed up clustering? show_parent_dend_line: when heatmap is split, whether to add a dashed line to mark parent dendrogram and children dendrograms? You can get or set option values by the traditional way (like base::options()) or by $ operator: ht_opt(&quot;heatmap_row_names_gp&quot;) ht_opt$heatmap_row_names_gp # to set option values ht_opt(&quot;heatmap_row_names_gp&quot; = gpar(fontsize = 8)) ht_opt$heatmap_row_names_gp = gpar(fontsize = 8) Reset to the default values by: ht_opt(RESET = TRUE) Following example shows to control some graphic parameters globally. ht_opt(heatmap_column_names_gp = gpar(fontface = &quot;italic&quot;), heatmap_column_title_gp = gpar(fontsize = 10), legend_border = &quot;black&quot;, heatmap_border = TRUE, annotation_border = TRUE ) ht1 = Heatmap(mat1, name = &quot;ht1&quot;, column_title = &quot;Heatmap 1&quot;, top_annotation = HeatmapAnnotation(foo = 1:10)) ht2 = Heatmap(mat2, name = &quot;ht2&quot;, column_title = &quot;Heatmap 2&quot;, top_annotation = HeatmapAnnotation(bar = 1:10)) ht1 + ht2 ht_opt(RESET = TRUE) These global parameters can also be set in the draw() function to temporarily change the global parameters, and they are reset back after the plot is made. Please check the help page of draw,HeatmapList-method. 4.14 Adjust blank space caused by annotations Heatmap annotations may have annotation names and axes, for which the spaces are also taken into account when arranging heatmap components in the final layout. Sometimes, this adjustment is not smart that you may see blank areas in the plot that are not necessary. One scenario is for a matrix with no row names, the space to the right of the heatmap is determined by the size of annotation name, which results in blank space between the heatmap and the legend. Also the heatmap list level row title is plotted to the left of the annotation axis, which gives blank area if there is no row dendrogram. adjust_annotation_extension controls whether to take account of the space of annotation names and axes for the layout. Compare following two plots. m = matrix(rnorm(100), 10) ht = Heatmap(m, name = &quot;mat&quot;, top_annotation = HeatmapAnnotation(foo = anno_points(1:10)), show_row_dend = FALSE) draw(ht, row_title = &quot;fooooooooooo&quot;, adjust_annotation_extension = TRUE, # default column_title = &quot;adjust_annotation_extension = TRUE&quot;) draw(ht, row_title = &quot;fooooooooooo&quot;, adjust_annotation_extension = FALSE, column_title = &quot;adjust_annotation_extension = FALSE&quot;) Another way to partially solve the space problem is to move the annotation name to the left and use heamtap-level row title. Heatmap(m, name = &quot;mat&quot;, top_annotation = HeatmapAnnotation(foo = anno_points(1:10), annotation_name_side = &quot;left&quot;), row_title = &quot;fooooooooooo&quot;, show_row_dend = FALSE) However, this adjustment for annotations sometimes is also necessary, e.g. when the heatmap is very short: ht = Heatmap(m, name = &quot;mat&quot;, top_annotation = HeatmapAnnotation(foo = anno_points(1:10)), show_row_dend = FALSE) draw(ht, row_title = &quot;fooooooooooo&quot;, adjust_annotation_extension = TRUE, column_title = &quot;adjust_annotation_extension = TRUE&quot;) Therefore, we set TRUE as the default of adjust_annotation_extension and users can configure it based on specific scenarios. 4.15 Manually increase space around the plot The layout of the ComplexHeatmap is not perfect that it is still possible some of the text are drawn out of the plotting region. In this case, you can manually set the padding argument in draw() function to increase the blank areas around the final plot. The value of padding should be a unit vector with length of four. The four values correspond to the space at the bottom, left, top and right sides. The following example is not a perfect example because the maximal width for row names can be controlled by max_row_name_width argument, but we can still use it to demonstrate the use of padding. m2 = m rownames(m2) = paste0(&quot;R&quot;, 1:10) rownames(m2)[1] = &quot;a long long long long long row name&quot; ht = Heatmap(m2, name = &quot;mat&quot;, row_names_side = &quot;left&quot;, show_row_dend = FALSE) draw(ht, padding = unit(c(2, 20, 2, 2), &quot;mm&quot;)) ## see right heatmap in following "],
["legends.html", "Chapter 5 Legends 5.1 Continuous legends 5.2 Discrete legends 5.3 A list of legends 5.4 Heatmap and annotation legends 5.5 Add customized legends 5.6 The side of legends", " Chapter 5 Legends The heatmaps and simple annotations automatically generate legends which are put one the right side of the heatmap. By default there is no legend for complex annotations, but they can be constructed and added manually (Section 5.5). All legends are internally constructed by Legend() constructor. In later sections, we first introduce the settings for continuous legends and discrete legends, then we will discuss how to configure the legends associated with the heatmaps and annotations, and how to add new legends to the plot. All the legends (no matter a single legend or a pack of legends) all belong to the Legends class. The class only has one slot grob which is the real grid::grob object or the grid::gTree object that records how to draw the graphics. The wrapping of the Legends class and the methods designed for the class make legends as single objects and can be drawn like points with specifying the positions on the viewport. The legends for heatmaps and annotations can be controlled by heatmap_legend_param argument in Heatmap(), or annotation_legend_param argument in HeatmapAnnotation(). Most of the parameters in Legend() function can be directly set in the two arguments with the same parameter name. The details of setting heatmap legends and annotation legends parameters are introduced in Section 5.4. 5.1 Continuous legends Since most of heatmaps contain continuous values, we first introduce the settings for the continuous legend. Continuous legend needs a color mapping function which should be generated by circlize::colorRamp2(). In the heatmap legends and annotation legends that are automatically generated, the color mapping functions are passed by the col argument from Heatmap() or HeatmapAnnotation() function, while if you construct a self-defined legend, you need to provide the color mapping function. The break values provided in the color mapping function (e.g. c(0, 0.5, 1) in following example) will not exactly be the same as the break values in the legends). The finally break values presented in the legend are internally adjusted to make the numbers of labels close to 5 or 6. First we show the default style of a vertical continuous legend: library(circlize) col_fun = colorRamp2(c(0, 0.5, 1), c(&quot;blue&quot;, &quot;white&quot;, &quot;red&quot;)) lgd = Legend(col_fun = col_fun, title = &quot;foo&quot;) lgd is a Legends class object. The size of the legend can be obtained by ComplexHeatmap:::width() and ComplexHeatmap:::height() function. ComplexHeatmap:::width(lgd) ## [1] 9.90361111111111mm ComplexHeatmap:::height(lgd) ## [1] 28.0329444444444mm The legend is actually a packed graphic object composed of rectangles, lines and texts. It can be added to the plot by draw() function. In ComplexHeatmap pacakge, you don’t need to use draw() directly on legend objects, but it might be useful if you use the legend objects in other places. pushViewport(viewport(width = 0.9, height = 0.9)) grid.rect() # border draw(lgd, x = unit(1, &quot;cm&quot;), y = unit(1, &quot;cm&quot;), just = c(&quot;left&quot;, &quot;bottom&quot;)) draw(lgd, x = unit(0.5, &quot;npc&quot;), y = unit(0.5, &quot;npc&quot;)) draw(lgd, x = unit(1, &quot;npc&quot;), y = unit(1, &quot;npc&quot;), just = c(&quot;right&quot;, &quot;top&quot;)) popViewport() If you only want to configure the legends generated by heatmaps or annotations, you don’t need to construct the Legends object by your own. The parameters introduced later can be directly used to customize the legends by heatmap_legend_param argument in Heatmap() and annotation_legend_param argument in HeatmapAnnotation() (introduced in Section 5.4). It is still nice to see how these parameters change the styles of the legend in following examples. Following is a simple example showing how to configure legends in the heatmap and heatmap annotation. Heatmap(matrix(rnorm(100), 10), heatmap_legend_param = list( title = &quot;rnorm&quot;, at = c(-2, 0, 2), labels = c(&quot;neg_two&quot;, &quot;zero&quot;, &quot;pos_two&quot;) ), top_annotation = HeatmapAnnotation( foo = 1:10, annotation_legend_param = list(foo = list(title = &quot;foo_top_anno&quot;)) )) In following examples, we only show how to construct the legend object, while not show the code which draws the legends. Only remember you can use draw() function on the Legends object to draw the single legend on the plot. For continuous legend, you can manually adjust the break values in the legend by setting at. Note the height is automatically adjusted. lgd = Legend(col_fun = col_fun, title = &quot;foo&quot;, at = c(0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1)) The labels corresponding to the break values are set by labels. lgd = Legend(col_fun = col_fun, title = &quot;foo&quot;, at = c(0, 0.5, 1), labels = c(&quot;low&quot;, &quot;median&quot;, &quot;high&quot;)) The height of the vertical continous legend is set by legend_height. legend_height can only be set for the veritcal continous legend and the value is the height of the legend body (excluding the legend title). lgd = Legend(col_fun = col_fun, title = &quot;foo&quot;, legend_height = unit(6, &quot;cm&quot;)) If it is a vertical legend, grid_width controls the widths of the legend body. grid_width is originally designed for the discrete legends where the each level in the legend is a grid, but here we use the same name for the parameter that controls the width of the legend. lgd = Legend(col_fun = col_fun, title = &quot;foo&quot;, grid_width = unit(1, &quot;cm&quot;)) The graphic parameters for the labels are controlled by labels_gp. lgd = Legend(col_fun = col_fun, title = &quot;foo&quot;, labels_gp = gpar(col = &quot;red&quot;, font = 3)) The border of the legend as well as the ticks for the break values are controlled by border. The value of border can be logical or a string of color. lgd = Legend(col_fun = col_fun, title = &quot;foo&quot;, border = &quot;red&quot;) title_position controls the position of titles. For vertical legends, the value should be one of topleft, topcenter, lefttop-rot and leftcenter-rot. Following two plots show the effect of lefttop-rot title and leftcenter-rot title. lgd = Legend(col_fun = col_fun, title = &quot;foooooooo&quot;, title_position = &quot;lefttop-rot&quot;, legend_height = unit(4, &quot;cm&quot;)) lgd = Legend(col_fun = col_fun, title = &quot;foooooooo&quot;, title_position = &quot;leftcenter-rot&quot;, legend_height = unit(4, &quot;cm&quot;)) Legend titles and labels can be set as mathematical formulas. lgd = Legend(col_fun = col_fun, title = expression(hat(beta) == (X^t * X)^{-1} * X^t * y), at = c(0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1), labels = expression(alpha, beta, gamma, delta, epsilon)) Settings for horizontal continuous legends are almost the same as vertical legends, except that now legend_width controls the width of the legend, and the title position can only be one of topcenter, topleft, lefttop and leftcenter. The default style for horizontal legend: lgd = Legend(col_fun = col_fun, title = &quot;foo&quot;, direction = &quot;horizontal&quot;) Manually set at: lgd = Legend(col_fun = col_fun, title = &quot;foo&quot;, at = c(0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1), direction = &quot;horizontal&quot;) Manually set labels: lgd = Legend(col_fun = col_fun, title = &quot;foo&quot;, at = c(0, 0.5, 1), labels = c(&quot;low&quot;, &quot;median&quot;, &quot;high&quot;), direction = &quot;horizontal&quot;) Set legend_width: lgd = Legend(col_fun = col_fun, title = &quot;foo&quot;, legend_width = unit(6, &quot;cm&quot;), direction = &quot;horizontal&quot;) Set graphic parameters for labels: lgd = Legend(col_fun = col_fun, title = &quot;foo&quot;, labels_gp = gpar(col = &quot;red&quot;, font = 3), direction = &quot;horizontal&quot;) Set rotations of labels. lgd = Legend(col_fun = col_fun, title = &quot;foo&quot;, labels_rot = 45, direction = &quot;horizontal&quot;) Title can be set as topleft, topcenter or lefttop and leftcenter. lgd = Legend(col_fun = col_fun, title = &quot;foooooooo&quot;, direction = &quot;horizontal&quot;, title_position = &quot;topcenter&quot;) lgd = Legend(col_fun = col_fun, title = &quot;foooooooo&quot;, direction = &quot;horizontal&quot;, title_position = &quot;lefttop&quot;) In examples we showed above, the intervals between every two break values are equal. Actually at can also be set as break values with uneuqal intervals. In this scenario, the ticks on the legend are still at the original places while the corresponding texts are shifted to get rid of overlapping. Then, there are lines connecting the ticks and the labels. lgd = Legend(col_fun = col_fun, title = &quot;foo&quot;, at = c(0, 0.1, 0.15, 0.5, 0.9, 0.95, 1)) If the labels do not need to be adjusted, they are still at the original places. lgd = Legend(col_fun = col_fun, title = &quot;foo&quot;, at = c(0, 0.3, 1), legend_height = unit(4, &quot;cm&quot;)) It is similar for the horizontal legends: lgd = Legend(col_fun = col_fun, title = &quot;foo&quot;, at = c(0, 0.1, 0.15, 0.5, 0.9, 0.95, 1), direction = &quot;horizontal&quot;) Set rotations of labels to 90 degree. lgd = Legend(col_fun = col_fun, title = &quot;foo&quot;, at = c(0, 0.1, 0.15, 0.5, 0.9, 0.95, 1), direction = &quot;horizontal&quot;, title_position = &quot;lefttop&quot;, labels_rot = 90) When the position of title is set to lefttop, the area below the title will also be taken into account when calculating the adjusted positions of labels. lgd = Legend(col_fun = col_fun, title = &quot;foo&quot;, at = c(0, 0.1, 0.5, 0.75, 1), labels = c(&quot;mininal&quot;, &quot;q10&quot;, &quot;median&quot;, &quot;q75&quot;, &quot;maximal&quot;), direction = &quot;horizontal&quot;, title_position = &quot;lefttop&quot;) 5.2 Discrete legends Discrete legends are used for discrete color mappings. The continuous color mapping can also be degenerated as discrete color mapping by only providing the colors and the break values. You can either specify at or labels, but most probably you specify labels. The colors should be specified by legend_gp. lgd = Legend(at = 1:6, title = &quot;foo&quot;, legend_gp = gpar(fill = 1:6)) lgd = Legend(labels = month.name[1:6], title = &quot;foo&quot;, legend_gp = gpar(fill = 1:6)) The discrete legend for continuous color mapping: at = seq(0, 1, by = 0.2) lgd = Legend(at = at, title = &quot;foo&quot;, legend_gp = gpar(fill = col_fun(at))) The position of title: lgd = Legend(labels = month.name[1:6], title = &quot;foo&quot;, legend_gp = gpar(fill = 1:6), title_position = &quot;lefttop&quot;) lgd = Legend(labels = month.name[1:6], title = &quot;foo&quot;, legend_gp = gpar(fill = 1:6), title_position = &quot;leftcenter-rot&quot;) The size of grids are controlled by grid_width and grid_height. lgd = Legend(at = 1:6, legend_gp = gpar(fill = 1:6), title = &quot;foo&quot;, grid_height = unit(1, &quot;cm&quot;), grid_width = unit(5, &quot;mm&quot;)) The graphic parameters of labels are controlled by labels_gp. lgd = Legend(labels = month.name[1:6], legend_gp = gpar(fill = 1:6), title = &quot;foo&quot;, labels_gp = gpar(col = &quot;red&quot;, fontsize = 14)) The graphic parameters of the title are controlled by title_gp. lgd = Legend(labels = month.name[1:6], legend_gp = gpar(fill = 1:6), title = &quot;foo&quot;, title_gp = gpar(col = &quot;red&quot;, fontsize = 14)) Borders of grids are controlled by border. lgd = Legend(labels = month.name[1:6], legend_gp = gpar(fill = 1:6), title = &quot;foo&quot;, border = &quot;red&quot;) One important thing for the discrete legend is you can arrange the grids into multiple rows or/and columns. If ncol is set to a number, the grids are arranged into ncol columns. lgd = Legend(labels = month.name[1:10], legend_gp = gpar(fill = 1:10), title = &quot;foo&quot;, ncol = 3) Still the title position is calculated based on the multiplt-column legend. lgd = Legend(labels = month.name[1:10], legend_gp = gpar(fill = 1:10), title = &quot;foo&quot;, ncol = 3, title_position = &quot;topcenter&quot;) You can choose to list the legend levels by rows by setting by_row = TRUE. lgd = Legend(labels = month.name[1:10], legend_gp = gpar(fill = 1:10), title = &quot;foo&quot;, ncol = 3, by_row = TRUE) The gap between two columns are controlled by gap. lgd = Legend(labels = month.name[1:10], legend_gp = gpar(fill = 1:10), title = &quot;foo&quot;, ncol = 3, gap = unit(1, &quot;cm&quot;)) Instead of ncol, you can also specify the layout by nrow. Note you cannot use ncol and nrow at a same time. lgd = Legend(labels = month.name[1:10], legend_gp = gpar(fill = 1:10), title = &quot;foo&quot;, nrow = 3) One extreme case is when all levels are put in one row and the title are rotated by 90 degree. The height of the legend will be the height of the rotated title. lgd = Legend(labels = month.name[1:6], legend_gp = gpar(fill = 1:6), title = &quot;foooooo&quot;, nrow = 1, title_position = &quot;lefttop-rot&quot;) Following style a lot of people might like: lgd = Legend(labels = month.name[1:6], legend_gp = gpar(fill = 1:6), title = &quot;foooooo&quot;, nrow = 1, title_position = &quot;leftcenter&quot;) Legend() also supports to use simple graphics (e.g. points, lines, boxplots) as legends. type argument can be specified as points or p that you can use number for pch or single-letter for pch. lgd = Legend(labels = month.name[1:6], title = &quot;foo&quot;, type = &quot;points&quot;, pch = 1:6, legend_gp = gpar(col = 1:6), background = &quot;#FF8080&quot;) lgd = Legend(labels = month.name[1:6], title = &quot;foo&quot;, type = &quot;points&quot;, pch = letters[1:6], legend_gp = gpar(col = 1:6), background = &quot;white&quot;) Or set type = \"lines\"/type = \"l\" to use lines as legend: lgd = Legend(labels = month.name[1:6], title = &quot;foo&quot;, type = &quot;lines&quot;, legend_gp = gpar(col = 1:6, lty = 1:6), grid_width = unit(1, &quot;cm&quot;)) Or set type = \"boxplot\"/type = \"box\" to use boxes as legends: lgd = Legend(labels = month.name[1:6], title = &quot;foo&quot;, type = &quot;boxplot&quot;, legend_gp = gpar(fill = 1:6)) When pch is an integer number, the numbers in 26:28 correspond to following symbols: lgd = Legend(labels = paste0(&quot;pch = &quot;, 26:28), type = &quot;points&quot;, pch = 26:28) If you want more legend styles to be supported, contact me. 5.3 A list of legends A list of legends can be constructed or packed as a Legends object where the individual legends are arranged within a certain layout. The legend list can be sent to packLegend() separatedly or as a list. The legend can be arranged either vertically or horizontally. ComplexHeatmap uses packLegend() internally to arrange multiple legends. Normally you don’t need to manually control the arrangement of multiple legends, but the following section would be useful if you want to manually construct a list of legends and apply to other plots. lgd1 = Legend(at = 1:6, legend_gp = gpar(fill = 1:6), title = &quot;legend1&quot;) lgd2 = Legend(col_fun = col_fun, title = &quot;legend2&quot;, at = c(0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1)) lgd3 = Legend(labels = month.name[1:3], legend_gp = gpar(fill = 7:9), title = &quot;legend3&quot;) pd = packLegend(lgd1, lgd2, lgd3) # which is same as pd = packLegend(list = list(lgd1, lgd2, lgd3)) Simillar as single legend, you can draw the packed legends by draw() function. Also you can get the size of pd by ComplexHeatmap:::width() and ComplexHeatmap:::height(). ComplexHeatmap:::width(pd) ## [1] 19.1675555555556mm ComplexHeatmap:::height(pd) ## [1] 72.0988333333333mm Horizontally arranging the legends simply by setting direction = \"horizontal\". pd = packLegend(lgd1, lgd2, lgd3, direction = &quot;horizontal&quot;) One feature of packLegend() is, e.g. if the packing is vertically and the sum of the packed legends exceeds the height specified by max_height, it will be rearragned as mutliple column layout. In following example, the maximum height is 10cm. When all the legends are put into multiple columns, column_gap controls the space between two columns. pd = packLegend(lgd1, lgd3, lgd2, lgd3, lgd2, lgd1, max_height = unit(10, &quot;cm&quot;), column_gap = unit(1, &quot;cm&quot;)) Similar for horizontal packing: lgd1 = Legend(at = 1:6, legend_gp = gpar(fill = 1:6), title = &quot;legend1&quot;, nr = 1) lgd2 = Legend(col_fun = col_fun, title = &quot;legend2&quot;, at = c(0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1), direction = &quot;horizontal&quot;) pd = packLegend(lgd1, lgd2, lgd3, lgd1, lgd2, lgd3, max_width = unit(10, &quot;cm&quot;), direction = &quot;horizontal&quot;, column_gap = unit(5, &quot;mm&quot;), row_gap = unit(1, &quot;cm&quot;)) The packed legends pd is also a Legends object, which means you can use draw() to draw it by specifying the positions. pd = packLegend(lgd1, lgd2, lgd3, direction = &quot;horizontal&quot;) pushViewport(viewport(width = 0.8, height = 0.8)) grid.rect() draw(pd, x = unit(1, &quot;cm&quot;), y = unit(1, &quot;cm&quot;), just = c(&quot;left&quot;, &quot;bottom&quot;)) popViewport() To be mentioned again, packLegend() is used internally to manage the list of heatmap and annotation legends. 5.4 Heatmap and annotation legends Settings for heatmap legend are controlled by heatmap_legend_param argument in Heatmap(). The value for heatmap_legend_param is a list of parameters which are supported in Legend(). m = matrix(rnorm(100), 10) Heatmap(m, name = &quot;mat&quot;, heatmap_legend_param = list( at = c(-2, 0, 2), labels = c(&quot;low&quot;, &quot;zero&quot;, &quot;high&quot;), title = &quot;Some values&quot;, legend_height = unit(4, &quot;cm&quot;), title_position = &quot;lefttop-rot&quot; )) annotation_legend_param controls legends for annotations. Since a HeatmapAnnotation may contain multiple annotations, the value of annotation_legend_param is a list of configurations of each annotation. ha = HeatmapAnnotation(foo = runif(10), bar = sample(c(&quot;f&quot;, &quot;m&quot;), 10, replace = TRUE), annotation_legend_param = list( foo = list( title = &quot;Fooooooh&quot;, at = c(0, 0.5, 1), labels = c(&quot;zero&quot;, &quot;median&quot;, &quot;one&quot;) ), bar = list( title = &quot;Baaaaaaar&quot;, at = c(&quot;f&quot;, &quot;m&quot;), labels = c(&quot;Female&quot;, &quot;Male&quot;) ) )) Heatmap(m, name = &quot;mat&quot;, top_annotation = ha) If the heatmaps are concatenated horizontally, all heatmap and row annotation legends are grouped and all column annotation legends ae grouped. The reason we assume the horizontal direction passes the main message of the plot, while the vertical direction provides secondary information. ha1 = HeatmapAnnotation(foo1 = runif(10), bar1 = sample(c(&quot;f&quot;, &quot;m&quot;), 10, replace = TRUE)) ha2 = HeatmapAnnotation(foo2 = runif(10), bar2 = sample(c(&quot;f&quot;, &quot;m&quot;), 10, replace = TRUE)) Heatmap(m, name = &quot;mat1&quot;, top_annotation = ha1) + rowAnnotation(sth = runif(10)) + Heatmap(m, name = &quot;mat2&quot;, top_annotation = ha2) Similarlly, if the heatmaps are concatenated vertically, all heatmaps/column annotations are grouped and legends for all row annotations are grouped. ha1 = HeatmapAnnotation(foo1 = runif(10), bar1 = sample(c(&quot;f&quot;, &quot;m&quot;), 10, replace = TRUE), annotation_name_side = &quot;left&quot;) ha2 = HeatmapAnnotation(foo2 = runif(10), bar2 = sample(c(&quot;f&quot;, &quot;m&quot;), 10, replace = TRUE)) Heatmap(m, name = &quot;mat1&quot;, top_annotation = ha1) %v% Heatmap(m, name = &quot;mat2&quot;, top_annotation = ha2, right_annotation = rowAnnotation(sth = 1:10)) show_legend in HeatmapAnnotation() and show_heatmap_legend in Heatmap() controls whether show the legends. Note show_legend can be a single logical value, a logical vector, or a named vector which controls subset of annotations. ha = HeatmapAnnotation(foo = runif(10), bar = sample(c(&quot;f&quot;, &quot;m&quot;), 10, replace = TRUE), show_legend = c(TRUE, FALSE), # it can also be show_legend = c(bar = FALSE) annotation_name_side = &quot;left&quot;) Heatmap(m, name = &quot;mat1&quot;, top_annotation = ha) + Heatmap(m, name = &quot;mat2&quot;, show_heatmap_legend = FALSE) merge_legend in draw() function controlls whether to merge all the legends into a single group. Normally, when there are many annotations and heatmaps, the number of legends is always large. In this case, the legends are automatically arranged into multiple columns (or multiple rows if they are put at the bottom of the heatmaps) to get rid of being out of the figure page. If a heatmap has heatmap annotations, the order of putting legends are: legends for the left annotations, legends for the top annotations, legend of the heatmap, legends for the bottom annotations and legends for the right annotations. ha1 = HeatmapAnnotation(foo1 = runif(10), bar1 = sample(c(&quot;f&quot;, &quot;m&quot;), 10, replace = TRUE)) ha2 = rowAnnotation(foo2 = runif(10), bar2 = sample(letters[1:3], 10, replace = TRUE)) ha3 = rowAnnotation(foo3 = runif(10), bar3 = sample(month.name[1:3], 10, replace = TRUE)) ht_list = Heatmap(m, name = &quot;mat1&quot;, top_annotation = ha1) + Heatmap(m, name = &quot;mat2&quot;, left_annotation = ha2) + ha3 draw(ht_list, merge_legend = TRUE) A continuous color mapping can have a discrete legend by setting color_bar = \"discrete\"), both work for heatmap legends and annotation legends. Heatmap(m, name = &quot;mat&quot;, heatmap_legend_param = list(color_bar = &quot;discrete&quot;), top_annotation = HeatmapAnnotation(foo = 1:10, annotation_legend_param = list( foo = list(color_bar = &quot;discrete&quot;)))) If the value is a character vector, no matter it is an annotation or the one-row/one-column matrix for the heatmap, the default order of legend labels is sort(unique(value)) and if value is a factor, the order of legend labels is levels(value). Always remember the order can be fine-tuned by setting at and labels parameters in heatmap_legend_param/annotation_legend_param in Heatmap()/HeamtapAnnotation() functions respectively. chr = sample(letters[1:3], 10, replace = TRUE) chr ## [1] &quot;a&quot; &quot;b&quot; &quot;a&quot; &quot;c&quot; &quot;c&quot; &quot;c&quot; &quot;b&quot; &quot;c&quot; &quot;b&quot; &quot;b&quot; fa1 = factor(chr) fa2 = factor(chr, levels = c(&quot;c&quot;, &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;)) Heatmap(m, top_annotation = HeatmapAnnotation(chr = chr, fa1 = fa1, fa2 = fa2, fa3 = fa2, annotation_legend_param = list(fa3 = list(at = c(&quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;, &quot;a&quot;))))) 5.5 Add customized legends The self-defined legends (constructed by Legend()) can be added to the heatmap legend list by heatmap_legend_list argument in draw() and the legends for annotations can be added to the annotation legend list by annotation_legend_list argument. There is a nice example of adding self-defined legends in Section 10.2, but here we show a simple example. As mentioned before, only the heatmap and simple annotations can generate legends on the plot. ComplexHeatmap provides many annotation functions, but none of them supports generating legends. In following code, we add a point annotation, a line annotation and a summary annotation to the heatmaps. ha1 = HeatmapAnnotation(pt = anno_points(1:10, gp = gpar(col = rep(2:3, each = 5)), height = unit(2, &quot;cm&quot;)), show_annotation_name = FALSE) ha2 = HeatmapAnnotation(ln = anno_lines(cbind(1:10, 10:1), gp = gpar(col = 4:5, lty = 1:2), height = unit(2, &quot;cm&quot;)), show_annotation_name = FALSE) m = matrix(rnorm(100), 10) ht_list = Heatmap(m, name = &quot;mat1&quot;, top_annotation = ha1) + Heatmap(m, name = &quot;mat2&quot;, top_annotation = ha2) + Heatmap(m[, 1], name = &quot;mat3&quot;, top_annotation = HeatmapAnnotation( summary = anno_summary(gp = gpar(fill = 2:3)) ), width = unit(1, &quot;cm&quot;)) draw(ht_list, ht_gap = unit(7, &quot;mm&quot;), row_km = 2) Next we construct legends for the points, the lines and the boxplots. lgd_list = list( Legend(labels = c(&quot;red&quot;, &quot;green&quot;), title = &quot;pt&quot;, type = &quot;points&quot;, pch = 16, legend_gp = gpar(col = 2:3)), Legend(labels = c(&quot;darkblue&quot;, &quot;lightblue&quot;), title = &quot;ln&quot;, type = &quot;lines&quot;, legend_gp = gpar(col = 4:5, lty = 1:2)), Legend(labels = c(&quot;group1&quot;, &quot;group2&quot;), title = &quot;km&quot;, type = &quot;boxplot&quot;, legend_gp = gpar(fill = 2:3)) ) draw(ht_list, ht_gap = unit(7, &quot;mm&quot;), row_km = 2, annotation_legend_list = lgd_list) 5.6 The side of legends By default, the heatmap legends and annotation legends are put on the right of the plot. The side relative to the heatmaps of the two types of legends can be controlled by heatmap_legend_side and annotation_legend_side arguments in draw() function. The values that can be set for the two arguments are left, right, bottom and top. m = matrix(rnorm(100), 10) ha1 = HeatmapAnnotation(foo1 = runif(10), bar1 = sample(c(&quot;f&quot;, &quot;m&quot;), 10, replace = TRUE)) ha2 = HeatmapAnnotation(foo2 = runif(10), bar2 = sample(c(&quot;f&quot;, &quot;m&quot;), 10, replace = TRUE)) ht_list = Heatmap(m, name = &quot;mat1&quot;, top_annotation = ha1) + rowAnnotation(sth = runif(10)) + Heatmap(m, name = &quot;mat2&quot;, top_annotation = ha2) draw(ht_list, heatmap_legend_side = &quot;left&quot;, annotation_legend_side = &quot;bottom&quot;) When the legends are put at the bottom or on the top, the legends are arranged horizontally. We might also want to set every single legend as horizontal legend, this needs to be set via the heatmap_legend_param and annotation_legend_param arguments in Heatmap() and HeatmapAnnotation() functions: ha1 = HeatmapAnnotation(foo1 = runif(10), bar1 = sample(c(&quot;f&quot;, &quot;m&quot;), 10, replace = TRUE), annotation_legend_param = list( foo1 = list(direction = &quot;horizontal&quot;), bar1 = list(nrow = 1))) ha2 = HeatmapAnnotation(foo2 = runif(10), bar2 = sample(c(&quot;f&quot;, &quot;m&quot;), 10, replace = TRUE), annotation_legend_param = list( foo2 = list(direction = &quot;horizontal&quot;), bar2 = list(nrow = 1))) ht_list = Heatmap(m, name = &quot;mat1&quot;, top_annotation = ha1, heatmap_legend_param = list(direction = &quot;horizontal&quot;)) + rowAnnotation(sth = runif(10), annotation_legend_param = list(sth = list(direction = &quot;horizontal&quot;))) + Heatmap(m, name = &quot;mat2&quot;, top_annotation = ha2, heatmap_legend_param = list(direction = &quot;horizontal&quot;)) draw(ht_list, merge_legend = TRUE, heatmap_legend_side = &quot;bottom&quot;, annotation_legend_side = &quot;bottom&quot;) "],
["heatmap-decoration.html", "Chapter 6 Heatmap Decoration 6.1 Decoration functions 6.2 Examples", " Chapter 6 Heatmap Decoration The plotting region for each heatmap component is still kept after the heatmaps are made, so it is possible to go back to the original places to add more graphics there.

To get rid of the complicated viewport names, the decorate_*() functions provide a more friendly way to do it. There are following decoration functions in ComplexHeatmap package: decorate_heatmap_body() decorate_annotation() decorate_dend() decorate_title() decorate_dimnames() decorate_row_names(), identical to decorate_dimnames(..., which = \"row\"). decorate_column_names(), identical to decorate_dimnames(..., which = \"column\"). decorate_row_dend(), identical to decorate_dend(..., which = \"row\"). decorate_column_dend(), identical to decorate_dend(..., which = \"column\"). decorate_row_title(), identical to decorate_title(..., which = \"row\"). decorate_column_title(), identical to decorate_title(..., which = \"column\"). Among them, decorate_heatmap_body() and decorate_annotation() are more often used. For all these functions, they need a heatmap or annotation name, index for the row/column slices if the heatmap is split and a code block which defines how to add graphics. Check following example. ht_list = draw(ht_list, row_title = &quot;Heatmap list&quot;, column_title = &quot;Heatmap list&quot;, heatmap_legend_side = &quot;right&quot;, annotation_legend_side = &quot;left&quot;) decorate_heatmap_body(&quot;ht1&quot;, { grid.text(&quot;outlier&quot;, 1.5/10, 2.5/4, default.units = &quot;npc&quot;) grid.lines(c(0.5, 0.5), c(0, 1), gp = gpar(lty = 2, lwd = 2)) }, slice = 2) decorate_column_dend(&quot;ht1&quot;, { tree = column_dend(ht_list)$ht1[[1]] ind = cutree(as.hclust(tree), k = 2)[order.dendrogram(tree)] first_index = function(l) which(l)[1] last_index = function(l) { x = which(l); x[length(x)] } x1 = c(first_index(ind == 1), first_index(ind == 2)) - 1 x2 = c(last_index(ind == 1), last_index(ind == 2)) grid.rect(x = x1/length(ind), width = (x2 - x1)/length(ind), just = &quot;left&quot;, default.units = &quot;npc&quot;, gp = gpar(fill = c(&quot;#FF000040&quot;, &quot;#00FF0040&quot;), col = NA)) }) decorate_row_names(&quot;ht1&quot;, { grid.rect(gp = gpar(fill = &quot;#FF000040&quot;)) }, slice = 2) decorate_row_title(&quot;ht1&quot;, { grid.rect(gp = gpar(fill = &quot;#00FF0040&quot;)) }, slice = 1) decorate_annotation(&quot;points&quot;, { grid.lines(c(0, 1), unit(c(0, 0), &quot;native&quot;), gp = gpar(col = &quot;red&quot;)) }) For annotations which are created by anno_points(), anno_barplot() and anno_boxplot(), “native” unit can be used in the decoration code. 6.2 Examples 6.2.1 Barplot for single-column heatmap In Section 3.16, we introduced adding barplots as annotations for single-column heatmap. In that case the heatmap contains discrete values where the barplots show the frequency of each level. In following example, we show another scenario of using barplot as annotation but for a continuous heatmap. Imagining we are analyzing a set of genomic regions (e.g. differentially methylated regions, DMRs) and we have a single-column heatmap which shows the overlap to e.g. genes (measured by the fraction of a DMR covered by genes, value between 0 and 1, e.g. a value of 0.5 means 50% of this DMR overlaps to the genes). If we denote the width of DMRs as \\(w\\) and the fraction as \\(p\\), on top of the fraction heatmap, we want to add barplots to show, on average, how much of the DMRs are covered by genes. In this case, we need to calcualte the mean fraction weighted by the width of DMRs (\\(\\sum{(w \\cdot p)}/\\sum{w}\\)). In following code, we randomly generated a fraction vector and split it into two groups. We first use anno_empty() to allocate empty plotting region on top of the heatmap and later we use decorate_annotation() to add the barplots into it. library(circlize) # DMRs bed = generateRandomBed(nr = 1000) # fractions frac = c(runif(400, min = 0.4, max = 1), runif(nrow(bed) - 400, min = 0.2, max = 0.6)) col_fun = colorRamp2(c(0, 1), c(&quot;white&quot;, &quot;orange&quot;)) # two groups split = c(rep(&quot;group1&quot;, 400), rep(&quot;group2&quot;, nrow(bed) - 400)) # draw the fraction heatmap with an empty annotation ht = Heatmap(frac, name = &quot;fraction&quot;, col = col_fun, width = unit(2, &quot;cm&quot;), top_annotation = HeatmapAnnotation(barplot = anno_empty(height = unit(4, &quot;cm&quot;)))) ht = draw(ht, row_split = split) # get the row indices in the two row-groups ro = row_order(ht) w = bed[, 3] - bed[, 2] # the mean weighted fraction in the two groups p = sapply(ro, function(index) { sum(w[index]*frac[index])/sum(w[index]) }) # add two bars of `p` decorate_annotation(&quot;barplot&quot;, { pushViewport(viewport(xscale = c(0.5, 2.5), yscale = c(0, max(p)*1.1))) grid.rect(x = 1:2, y = 0, width = 0.8, height = p, just = &quot;bottom&quot;, gp = gpar(fill = &quot;orange&quot;), default.units = &quot;native&quot;) grid.yaxis() grid.text(&quot;mean fraction&quot;, x = unit(-1.5, &quot;cm&quot;),rot = 90, just = &quot;bottom&quot;) popViewport() }) 6.2.2 Add titles for row annotations Row annotations can be concatenated to the heatmap list. Sometimes we need a title for the row annotation. It is easy to implement it by decorations. ht_list = Heatmap(matrix(rnorm(100), 10), name = &quot;mat&quot;, show_column_dend = FALSE) + rowAnnotation(foo = anno_barplot(1:10, width = unit(4, &quot;cm&quot;))) + rowAnnotation(bar = anno_boxplot(matrix(rnorm(100), 10)), width = unit(4, &quot;cm&quot;)) draw(ht_list, padding = unit(c(2, 2, 10, 2), &quot;mm&quot;)) # add space for titles decorate_annotation(&quot;foo&quot;, { grid.text(&quot;title for barplot&quot;, y = unit(1, &quot;npc&quot;) + unit(2, &quot;mm&quot;), just = &quot;bottom&quot;) }) decorate_annotation(&quot;bar&quot;, { grid.text(&quot;title for boxplot&quot;, y = unit(1, &quot;npc&quot;) + unit(2, &quot;mm&quot;), just = &quot;bottom&quot;) }) decorate_heatmap_body(&quot;mat&quot;, { grid.text(&quot;title for the heatmap&quot;, y = unit(1, &quot;npc&quot;) + unit(2, &quot;mm&quot;), just = &quot;bottom&quot;) }) This is basically the way we use in Section 10.2. 6.2.3 Other possible use of decorations There are some other examples where decoration is helpful: The quantile lines are added in densityHeatmap(), Section 10.1. Heatmap annotations are grouped by lines, Section 9.5. Texts are added to heatmaps, Section 9.2. "],
["oncoprint.html", "Chapter 7 OncoPrint 7.1 General settings 7.2 Apply to cBioPortal dataset", " Chapter 7 OncoPrint OncoPrint is a way to visualize multiple genomic alteration events by heatmap. Here the ComplexHeatmap package provides a oncoPrint() function which makes oncoPrints. Besides the default style which is provided by cBioPortal, there are additional barplots at both sides of the heatmap which show numbers of different alterations for each sample and for each gene. Also with the functionality of ComplexHeatmap, you can concatenate oncoPrints with additional heatmaps and annotations to correspond more types of information. 7.1 General settings 7.1.1 Input data format There are two different formats of input data. The first is represented as a matrix in which each value can include multiple alterations in a form of a complicated string. In follow example, ‘g1’ in ‘s1’ has two types of alterations which are ‘snv’ and ‘indel’. mat = read.table(textConnection( &quot;s1,s2,s3 g1,snv;indel,snv,indel g2,,snv;indel,snv g3,snv,,indel;snv&quot;), row.names = 1, header = TRUE, sep = &quot;,&quot;, stringsAsFactors = FALSE) mat = as.matrix(mat) mat ## s1 s2 s3 ## g1 &quot;snv;indel&quot; &quot;snv&quot; &quot;indel&quot; ## g2 &quot;&quot; &quot;snv;indel&quot; &quot;snv&quot; ## g3 &quot;snv&quot; &quot;&quot; &quot;indel;snv&quot; In this case, we need to define a function to extract different alteration types from these long strings. The definition of such function is always simple, it accepts the complicated string and returns a vector of alteration types. For mat, we can define the function as: get_type_fun = function(x) strsplit(x, &quot;;&quot;)[[1]] get_type_fun(mat[1, 1]) ## [1] &quot;snv&quot; &quot;indel&quot; get_type_fun(mat[1, 2]) ## [1] &quot;snv&quot; So, if the alterations are encoded as snv|indel, you can define the function as function(x) strsplit(x, \"|\")[[1]]. This self-defined function is assigned to the get_type argument in oncoPrint(). Since in most cases, the separators are only single characters, If the separators are in ;:,|, oncoPrint() automatically spit the alteration strings so that you don’t need to explicitely specify get_type in oncoPrint() function. For one gene in one sample, since different alteration types may be drawn into one same grid in the heatmap, we need to define how to add the graphics by providing a list of self-defined functions to alter_fun argument. Here if the graphics have no transparency, order of adding graphics matters. In following example, snv are first drawn and then the indel. You can see rectangles for indels are actually smaller (0.4*h) than that for snvs (0.9*h) so that you can visualize both snvs and indels if they are in a same grid. Names of the function list should correspond to the alteration types (here, snv and indel). For the self-defined graphic function (the functions in alter_fun, there should be four arguments which are positions of the grids on the oncoPrint (x and y), and widths and heights of the grids (w and h, which is measured in npc unit). Proper values for the four arguments are sent to these functions automatically from oncoPrint(). Colors for different alterations are defined in col. It should be a named vector for which names correspond to alteration types. It is used to generate the barplots and the legends. col = c(snv = &quot;red&quot;, indel = &quot;blue&quot;) oncoPrint(mat, alter_fun = list( snv = function(x, y, w, h) grid.rect(x, y, w*0.9, h*0.9, gp = gpar(fill = col[&quot;snv&quot;], col = NA)), indel = function(x, y, w, h) grid.rect(x, y, w*0.9, h*0.4, gp = gpar(fill = col[&quot;indel&quot;], col = NA)) ), col = col) You can see the order in barplots also correspond to the order defined in alter_fun. If you are confused of how to generated the matrix, there is a second way. The second type of input data is a list of matrix for which each matrix contains binary value representing whether the alteration is absent or present. The list should have names which correspond to the alteration types. mat_list = list(snv = matrix(c(1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1), nrow = 3), indel = matrix(c(1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0), nrow = 3)) rownames(mat_list$snv) = rownames(mat_list$indel) = c(&quot;g1&quot;, &quot;g2&quot;, &quot;g3&quot;) colnames(mat_list$snv) = colnames(mat_list$indel) = c(&quot;s1&quot;, &quot;s2&quot;, &quot;s3&quot;) mat_list ## $snv ## s1 s2 s3 ## g1 1 1 0 ## g2 0 1 1 ## g3 1 0 1 ## ## $indel ## s1 s2 s3 ## g1 1 0 1 ## g2 0 1 0 ## g3 0 0 0 oncoPrint() expects all matrices in mat_list having same row names and column names. Pass mat_list to oncoPrint(): # now you don&#39;t need `get_type` oncoPrint(mat_list, alter_fun = list( snv = function(x, y, w, h) grid.rect(x, y, w*0.9, h*0.9, gp = gpar(fill = col[&quot;snv&quot;], col = NA)), indel = function(x, y, w, h) grid.rect(x, y, w*0.9, h*0.4, gp = gpar(fill = col[&quot;indel&quot;], col = NA)) ), col = col) In following parts of this chapter, we still use the single matrix form mat to specify the input data. 7.1.2 Define the alter_fun() alter_fun is a list of functons which add graphics layer by layer (i.e. first draw for snv, then for indel). Graphics can also be added in a grid-by-grid style by specifying alter_fun as a single function. The difference from the function list is now alter_fun should accept a fifth argument which is a logical vector. This logical vector shows whether different alterations exist for current gene in current sample. Let’s assume in a grid there is only snv event, then v for this grid is: ## snv indel ## TRUE FALSE oncoPrint(mat, alter_fun = function(x, y, w, h, v) { if(v[&quot;snv&quot;]) grid.rect(x, y, w*0.9, h*0.9, # v[&quot;snv&quot;] is a logical value gp = gpar(fill = col[&quot;snv&quot;], col = NA)) if(v[&quot;indel&quot;]) grid.rect(x, y, w*0.9, h*0.4, # v[&quot;indel&quot;] is a logical value gp = gpar(fill = col[&quot;indel&quot;], col = NA)) }, col = col) If alter_fun is set as a single function, customization can be more flexible. In following example, the blue rectangles can have different height in different grid. oncoPrint(mat, alter_fun = function(x, y, w, h, v) { n = sum(v) # how many alterations for current gene in current sample h = h*0.9 # use `names(which(v))` to correctly map between `v` and `col` if(n) grid.rect(x, y - h*0.5 + 1:n/n*h, w*0.9, 1/n*h, gp = gpar(fill = col[names(which(v))], col = NA), just = &quot;top&quot;) }, col = col) Following is a complicated example for alter_fun where triangles are used: oncoPrint(mat, alter_fun = list( background = function(x, y, w, h) { grid.polygon( unit.c(x - 0.5*w, x - 0.5*w, x + 0.5*w), unit.c(y - 0.5*h, y + 0.5*h, y - 0.5*h), gp = gpar(fill = &quot;grey&quot;, col = &quot;white&quot;)) grid.polygon( unit.c(x + 0.5*w, x + 0.5*w, x - 0.5*w), unit.c(y + 0.5*h, y - 0.5*h, y + 0.5*h), gp = gpar(fill = &quot;grey&quot;, col = &quot;white&quot;)) }, snv = function(x, y, w, h) { grid.polygon( unit.c(x - 0.5*w, x - 0.5*w, x + 0.5*w), unit.c(y - 0.5*h, y + 0.5*h, y - 0.5*h), gp = gpar(fill = col[&quot;snv&quot;], col = &quot;white&quot;)) }, indel = function(x, y, w, h) { grid.polygon( unit.c(x + 0.5*w, x + 0.5*w, x - 0.5*w), unit.c(y + 0.5*h, y - 0.5*h, y + 0.5*h), gp = gpar(fill = col[&quot;indel&quot;], col = &quot;white&quot;)) } ), col = col) In some cases, you might need to define alter_fun for many alteration types. If you are not sure about the visual effect of your alter_fun, you can use test_alter_fun() to test your alter_fun. In following example, we defined seven alteration functions: alter_fun = list( mut1 = function(x, y, w, h) grid.rect(x, y, w, h, gp = gpar(fill = &quot;red&quot;, col = NA)), mut2 = function(x, y, w, h) grid.rect(x, y, w, h, gp = gpar(fill = &quot;blue&quot;, col = NA)), mut3 = function(x, y, w, h) grid.rect(x, y, w, h, gp = gpar(fill = &quot;yellow&quot;, col = NA)), mut4 = function(x, y, w, h) grid.rect(x, y, w, h, gp = gpar(fill = &quot;purple&quot;, col = NA)), mut5 = function(x, y, w, h) grid.rect(x, y, w, h, gp = gpar(fill = NA, lwd = 2)), mut6 = function(x, y, w, h) grid.points(x, y, pch = 16), mut7 = function(x, y, w, h) grid.segments(x - w*0.5, y - h*0.5, x + w*0.5, y + h*0.5, gp = gpar(lwd = 2)) ) test_alter_fun(alter_fun) ## `alter_fun` is defined as a list of functions. ## Functions are defined for following alteration types: ## mut1, mut2, mut3, mut4, mut5, mut6, mut7 For the combination of alteration types, test_alter_fun() randomly samples some of them. test_alter_fun() works both for alter_fun as a list and as a single function. 7.1.3 Background If alter_fun is specified as a list, the order of the elements controls the order of adding graphics. There is a special element called background which defines how to draw background and it should be always put as the first element in the alter_fun list. In following example, backgrond color is changed to light green with borders. oncoPrint(mat, alter_fun = list( background = function(x, y, w, h) grid.rect(x, y, w, h, gp = gpar(fill = &quot;#00FF0020&quot;)), snv = function(x, y, w, h) grid.rect(x, y, w*0.9, h*0.9, gp = gpar(fill = col[&quot;snv&quot;], col = NA)), indel = function(x, y, w, h) grid.rect(x, y, w*0.9, h*0.4, gp = gpar(fill = col[&quot;indel&quot;], col = NA)) ), col = col) Or just remove the background (don’t set it to NULL. Setting background directly to NULL means to use the default style of background whch is in grey): oncoPrint(mat, alter_fun = list( background = function(...) NULL, snv = function(x, y, w, h) grid.rect(x, y, w*0.9, h*0.9, gp = gpar(fill = col[&quot;snv&quot;], col = NA)), indel = function(x, y, w, h) grid.rect(x, y, w*0.9, h*0.4, gp = gpar(fill = col[&quot;indel&quot;], col = NA)) ), col = col) 7.1.4 Complex alteration types It is very easy to have many more different alteration types when integrating information from multiple analysis results. It is sometimes difficult to design graphics and assign different colors for them (e.g. see plot in this link. On the other hand, in these alteration types, there are primary classes of alteration types which is more important to distinguish, while there are secondary classes which is less important. For example, we may have alteration types of “intronic snv”, “exonic snv”, “intronic indel” and “exonic indel”. Actually we can classify them into two classes where “snv/indel” is more important and they belong to the primary class, and “intronic/exonic” is less important and they belong to the secondary class. Reflecting on the oncoPrint, for the “intronic snv” and “exonic snv”, we want to use similar graphics because they are snvs and we want them visually similar, and we add slightly different symbols to represent “intronic” and “exonic”, E.g. we can use red rectangle for snv and above the red rectangles, we use dots to represent “intronic” and cross lines to represent “exonic”. On the barplot annotations which summarize the number of different alteration types, we don’t want to separate “intronic snv” and “exonic snv” while we prefer to simply get the total number of snv to get rid of too many categories in the barplots. Let’s demonstrate this scenario by following simulated data. To simplify the example, we assume for a single gene in a single sample, it only has either snv or indel and it can only be either intronic or exonic. If there is no “intronic” or “exonic” attached to the gene, it basically means we don’t have this gene-related information (maybe it is an intergenic snv/indel). set.seed(123) x1 = sample(c(&quot;&quot;, &quot;snv&quot;), 100, replace = TRUE, prob = c(8, 2)) x2 = sample(c(&quot;&quot;, &quot;indel&quot;), 100, replace = TRUE, prob = c(8, 2)) x2[x1 == &quot;snv&quot;] = &quot;&quot; x3 = sample(c(&quot;&quot;, &quot;intronic&quot;), 100, replace = TRUE, prob = c(5, 5)) x4 = sample(c(&quot;&quot;, &quot;exonic&quot;), 100, replace = TRUE, prob = c(5, 5)) x3[x1 == &quot;&quot; &amp; x2 == &quot;&quot;] = &quot;&quot; x4[x1 == &quot;&quot; &amp; x2 == &quot;&quot;] = &quot;&quot; x4[x3 == &quot;intronic&quot;] = &quot;&quot; x = apply(cbind(x1, x2, x3, x4), 1, function(x) { x = x[x != &quot;&quot;] paste(x, collapse = &quot;;&quot;) }) m = matrix(x, nrow = 10, ncol = 10, dimnames = list(paste0(&quot;g&quot;, 1:10), paste0(&quot;s&quot;, 1:10))) m[1:4, 1:4] ## s1 s2 s3 s4 ## g1 &quot;&quot; &quot;snv;intronic&quot; &quot;snv;intronic&quot; &quot;snv&quot; ## g2 &quot;&quot; &quot;&quot; &quot;&quot; &quot;snv;intronic&quot; ## g3 &quot;&quot; &quot;&quot; &quot;&quot; &quot;&quot; ## g4 &quot;snv&quot; &quot;indel;exonic&quot; &quot;snv&quot; &quot;&quot; Now in m, there are four different alteration types: snv, indel, intronic and exonic. Next we define alter_fun for the four alterations. alter_fun = list( background = function(x, y, w, h) grid.rect(x, y, w*0.9, h*0.9, gp = gpar(fill = &quot;#CCCCCC&quot;, col = NA)), # red rectangles snv = function(x, y, w, h) grid.rect(x, y, w*0.9, h*0.9, gp = gpar(fill = &quot;red&quot;, col = NA)), # blue rectangles indel = function(x, y, w, h) grid.rect(x, y, w*0.9, h*0.9, gp = gpar(fill = &quot;blue&quot;, col = NA)), # dots intronic = function(x, y, w, h) grid.points(x, y, pch = 16), # crossed lines exonic = function(x, y, w, h) { grid.segments(x - w*0.4, y - h*0.4, x + w*0.4, y + h*0.4, gp = gpar(lwd = 2)) grid.segments(x + w*0.4, y - h*0.4, x - w*0.4, y + h*0.4, gp = gpar(lwd = 2)) } ) For the alteration types in the primary class (snv and indel), we use colorred rectangles to represent them because the rectangles are visually obvious, while for the alteration types in the secondary class (intronic and exonic), we only use simple symbols (dots for intronic and crossed diagonal lines for exonic). Since there is no color corresponding to intronic and exonic, we don’t need to define colors for these two types, and on the barplot annotation for genes and samples, only snv and indel are visualized (so the height for snv in the barplot corresponds the number of intronic snv plus exonic snv). In following code which draws the oncoPrint, we add another legend for the intronic/exonic types. note a pch value of 16 corresponds to a dot and a value of 28 corresponds to crossed diagonal lines (see the last plot in Section 5.2 for pch 26, 27, 28). # we only define color for snv and indel, so barplot annotations only show snv and indel ht = oncoPrint(m, alter_fun = alter_fun, col = c(snv = &quot;red&quot;, indel = &quot;blue&quot;)) draw(ht, heatmap_legend_list = list( Legend(labels = c(&quot;intronic&quot;, &quot;exonic&quot;), type = &quot;points&quot;, pch = c(16, 28)) )) 7.1.5 Simplify alter_fun If the graphics are only simple graphics, e.g., rectangles, points, the graphic functions can be automatically generated by alter_graphic() function. One of previous example can be simplied as: oncoPrint(mat, alter_fun = list( snv = alter_graphic(&quot;rect&quot;, width = 0.9, height = 0.9, fill = col[&quot;snv&quot;]), indel = alter_graphic(&quot;rect&quot;, width = 0.9, height = 0.4, fill = col[&quot;indel&quot;]) ), col = col) 7.1.6 Other heatmap-related settings Column names are by default not drawn in the plot. It is can be turned on by setting show_column_names = TRUE. alter_fun = list( snv = function(x, y, w, h) grid.rect(x, y, w*0.9, h*0.9, gp = gpar(fill = col[&quot;snv&quot;], col = NA)), indel = function(x, y, w, h) grid.rect(x, y, w*0.9, h*0.4, gp = gpar(fill = col[&quot;indel&quot;], col = NA)) ) oncoPrint(mat, alter_fun = alter_fun, col = col, show_column_names = TRUE) Row names and percent texts can be turned on/off by setting show_pct and show_row_names. The side of both according to the oncoPrint is controlled by pct_side and row_names_side. Digits of the percent values are controlled by pct_digits. oncoPrint(mat, alter_fun = alter_fun, col = col, row_names_side = &quot;left&quot;, pct_side = &quot;right&quot;, pct_digits = 2) The barplot annotations on the both side are controlled by anno_oncoprint_barplot() annotation function. Customization such as the size and the axes can be set directly in anno_oncoprint_barplot(). More examples of setting anno_oncoprint_barplot() can be found in Section 7.2.3. oncoPrint(mat, alter_fun = alter_fun, col = col, top_annotation = HeatmapAnnotation( cbar = anno_oncoprint_barplot(height = unit(1, &quot;cm&quot;))), right_annotation = rowAnnotation( rbar = anno_oncoprint_barplot( width = unit(4, &quot;cm&quot;), axis_param = list(at = c(0, 2, 4), labels = c(&quot;zero&quot;, &quot;two&quot;, &quot;four&quot;), side = &quot;top&quot;, labels_rot = 0))), ) Some people might want to move the right barplots to the left of the oncoPrint: oncoPrint(mat, alter_fun = alter_fun, col = col, left_annotation = rowAnnotation( rbar = anno_oncoprint_barplot( axis_param = list(direction = &quot;reverse&quot;) )), right_annotation = NULL) OncoPrints essentially are heatmaps, thus, there are many arguments set in Heatmap() can also be set in oncoPrint(). In following section, we use a real-world dataset to demonstrate more use of oncoPrint() function. 7.2 Apply to cBioPortal dataset We use a real-world dataset to demonstrate advanced usage of oncoPrint(). The data is retrieved from cBioPortal. Steps for getting the data are as follows: go to http://www.cbioportal.org, search Cancer Study: “Lung Adenocarcinoma Carcinoma” and select: “Lung Adenocarcinoma Carcinoma (TCGA, Provisinal)”, in “Enter Gene Set” field, select: “General: Ras-Raf-MEK-Erk/JNK signaling (26 genes)”, submit the form. In the result page, go to “Download” tab, download text in “Type of Genetic alterations across all cases”. The order of samples can also be downloaded from the results page, go to “OncoPrint” tab, move the mouse above the plot, click “download” icon and click “Sample order”. The data is already in ComplexHeatmap package. First we read the data and make some pre-processing. mat = read.table(system.file(&quot;extdata&quot;, package = &quot;ComplexHeatmap&quot;, &quot;tcga_lung_adenocarcinoma_provisional_ras_raf_mek_jnk_signalling.txt&quot;), header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE, sep = &quot;\\t&quot;) mat[is.na(mat)] = &quot;&quot; rownames(mat) = mat[, 1] mat = mat[, -1] mat= mat[, -ncol(mat)] mat = t(as.matrix(mat)) mat[1:3, 1:3] ## TCGA-05-4384-01 TCGA-05-4390-01 TCGA-05-4425-01 ## KRAS &quot; &quot; &quot;MUT;&quot; &quot; &quot; ## HRAS &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ## BRAF &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; There are three different alterations in mat: HOMDEL, AMP and MUT. We first define how to add graphics for different alterations. col = c(&quot;HOMDEL&quot; = &quot;blue&quot;, &quot;AMP&quot; = &quot;red&quot;, &quot;MUT&quot; = &quot;#008000&quot;) alter_fun = list( background = function(x, y, w, h) { grid.rect(x, y, w-unit(2, &quot;pt&quot;), h-unit(2, &quot;pt&quot;), gp = gpar(fill = &quot;#CCCCCC&quot;, col = NA)) }, # big blue HOMDEL = function(x, y, w, h) { grid.rect(x, y, w-unit(2, &quot;pt&quot;), h-unit(2, &quot;pt&quot;), gp = gpar(fill = col[&quot;HOMDEL&quot;], col = NA)) }, # big red AMP = function(x, y, w, h) { grid.rect(x, y, w-unit(2, &quot;pt&quot;), h-unit(2, &quot;pt&quot;), gp = gpar(fill = col[&quot;AMP&quot;], col = NA)) }, # small green MUT = function(x, y, w, h) { grid.rect(x, y, w-unit(2, &quot;pt&quot;), h*0.33, gp = gpar(fill = col[&quot;MUT&quot;], col = NA)) } ) Just a note, since the graphics are all rectangles, they can be simplied by generating by alter_graphic(): # just for demonstration alter_fun = list( background = alter_graphic(&quot;rect&quot;, fill = &quot;#CCCCCC&quot;), HOMDEL = alter_graphic(&quot;rect&quot;, fill = col[&quot;HOMDEL&quot;]), AMP = alter_graphic(&quot;rect&quot;, fill = col[&quot;AMP&quot;]), MUT = alter_graphic(&quot;rect&quot;, height = 0.33, fill = col[&quot;MUT&quot;]) ) Now we make the oncoPrint. We save column_title and heatmap_legend_param as varaibles because they are used multiple times in following code chunks. column_title = &quot;OncoPrint for TCGA Lung Adenocarcinoma, genes in Ras Raf MEK JNK signalling&quot; heatmap_legend_param = list(title = &quot;Alternations&quot;, at = c(&quot;HOMDEL&quot;, &quot;AMP&quot;, &quot;MUT&quot;), labels = c(&quot;Deep deletion&quot;, &quot;Amplification&quot;, &quot;Mutation&quot;)) oncoPrint(mat, alter_fun = alter_fun, col = col, column_title = column_title, heatmap_legend_param = heatmap_legend_param) As you see, the genes and samples are reordered automatically. Rows are sorted based on the frequency of the alterations in all samples and columns are reordered to visualize the mutual exclusivity between samples. The column reordering is based on the “memo sort” method, adapted from https://gist.github.com/armish/564a65ab874a770e2c26. 7.2.1 Remove empty rows and columns By default, if samples or genes have no alterations, they will still remain in the heatmap, but you can set remove_empty_columns and remove_empty_rows to TRUE to remove them: oncoPrint(mat, alter_fun = alter_fun, col = col, remove_empty_columns = TRUE, remove_empty_rows = TRUE, column_title = column_title, heatmap_legend_param = heatmap_legend_param) The number of rows and columns may be reduced after empty rows and columns are removed. All the components of the oncoPrint are adjusted accordingly. When the oncoPrint is concatenated with other heatmaps and annotations, this may cause a problem that the number of rows or columns are not all identical in the heatmap list. So, if you put oncoPrint into a heatmap list and you don’t want to see empty rows or columns, you need to remove them manually before sending to oncoPrint() function (this preprocess should be very easy for you!). 7.2.2 Reorder the oncoPrint As the normal Heatmap() function, row_order or column_order can be assigned with a vector of orders (either numeric or character). In following example, the order of samples are gathered from cBio as well. You can see the difference for the sample order between ‘memo sort’ and the method used by cBio. sample_order = scan(paste0(system.file(&quot;extdata&quot;, package = &quot;ComplexHeatmap&quot;), &quot;/sample_order.txt&quot;), what = &quot;character&quot;) oncoPrint(mat, alter_fun = alter_fun, col = col, row_order = 1:nrow(mat), column_order = sample_order, remove_empty_columns = TRUE, remove_empty_rows = TRUE, column_title = column_title, heatmap_legend_param = heatmap_legend_param) Again, row_order and column_order are automatically adjusted if remove_empty_rows and remove_empty_columns are set to TRUE. 7.2.3 OncoPrint annotations The oncoPrint has several pre-defined annotations. On top and right of the oncoPrint, there are barplots showing the number of different alterations for each gene or for each sample, and on the left of the oncoPrint is a text annotation showing the percent of samples that have alterations for every gene. The barplot annotation is implemented by anno_oncoprint_barplot() where you can set the the annotation there. Barplots by default draw for all alteration types, but you can also select subset of alterations to put on barplots by setting in anno_oncoprint_barplot(). See following example: oncoPrint(mat, alter_fun = alter_fun, col = col, top_annotation = HeatmapAnnotation( column_barplot = anno_oncoprint_barplot(&quot;MUT&quot;, border = TRUE, # only MUT height = unit(4, &quot;cm&quot;))), right_annotation = rowAnnotation( row_barplot = anno_oncoprint_barplot(c(&quot;AMP&quot;, &quot;HOMDEL&quot;), # only AMP and HOMDEL border = TRUE, height = unit(4, &quot;cm&quot;), axis_param = list(side = &quot;bottom&quot;, labels_rot = 90))), remove_empty_columns = TRUE, remove_empty_rows = TRUE, column_title = column_title, heatmap_legend_param = heatmap_legend_param) The percent values and row names are internally constructed as text annotations. You can set show_pct and show_row_names to turn them on or off. pct_side and row_names_side controls the sides where they are put. oncoPrint(mat, alter_fun = alter_fun, col = col, remove_empty_columns = TRUE, remove_empty_rows = TRUE, pct_side = &quot;right&quot;, row_names_side = &quot;left&quot;, column_title = column_title, heatmap_legend_param = heatmap_legend_param) The barplot annotation for oncoPrint are essentially normal annotations, you can add more annotations in HeatmapAnnotation() or rowAnnotation() in the normal way: oncoPrint(mat, alter_fun = alter_fun, col = col, remove_empty_columns = TRUE, remove_empty_rows = TRUE, top_annotation = HeatmapAnnotation(cbar = anno_oncoprint_barplot(), foo1 = 1:172, bar1 = anno_points(1:172)), left_annotation = rowAnnotation(foo2 = 1:26), right_annotation = rowAnnotation(bar2 = anno_barplot(1:26)), column_title = column_title, heatmap_legend_param = heatmap_legend_param) As you see, the percent annotation, the row name annotation and the oncoPrint annotation are appended to the user-specified annotation by default. Also annotations are automatically adjusted if remove_empty_columns and remove_empty_rows are set to TRUE. 7.2.4 oncoPrint as a Heatmap oncoPrint() actually returns a Heatmap object, so you can add more heatmaps and annotations horizontally or vertically to visualize more complicated associations. Following example adds a heatmap horizontally. Remember you can always add row annotations to the heatmap list. ht_list = oncoPrint(mat, alter_fun = alter_fun, col = col, column_title = column_title, heatmap_legend_param = heatmap_legend_param) + Heatmap(matrix(rnorm(nrow(mat)*10), ncol = 10), name = &quot;expr&quot;, width = unit(4, &quot;cm&quot;)) draw(ht_list) or add it vertically: ht_list = oncoPrint(mat, alter_fun = alter_fun, col = col, column_title = column_title, heatmap_legend_param = heatmap_legend_param) %v% Heatmap(matrix(rnorm(ncol(mat)*10), nrow = 10), name = &quot;expr&quot;, height = unit(4, &quot;cm&quot;)) draw(ht_list) Similar as normal heatmap list, you can split the heatmap list: ht_list = oncoPrint(mat, alter_fun = alter_fun, col = col, column_title = column_title, heatmap_legend_param = heatmap_legend_param) + Heatmap(matrix(rnorm(nrow(mat)*10), ncol = 10), name = &quot;expr&quot;, width = unit(4, &quot;cm&quot;)) draw(ht_list, row_split = sample(c(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;), nrow(mat), replace = TRUE)) When remove_empty_columns or remove_empty_rows is set to TRUE, the number of genes or the samples may not be the original number. If the original matrix has row names and column names. The subset of rows and columns can be get as follows: ht = oncoPrint(mat, alter_fun = alter_fun, col = col, remove_empty_columns = TRUE, remove_empty_rows = TRUE, column_title = column_title, heatmap_legend_param = heatmap_legend_param) rownames(ht@matrix) ## [1] &quot;KRAS&quot; &quot;HRAS&quot; &quot;BRAF&quot; &quot;RAF1&quot; &quot;MAP3K1&quot; &quot;MAP3K2&quot; &quot;MAP3K3&quot; &quot;MAP3K4&quot; ## [9] &quot;MAP3K5&quot; &quot;MAP2K1&quot; &quot;MAP2K2&quot; &quot;MAP2K3&quot; &quot;MAP2K4&quot; &quot;MAPK3&quot; &quot;MAPK4&quot; &quot;MAPK7&quot; ## [17] &quot;MAPK8&quot; &quot;MAPK9&quot; &quot;MAPK12&quot; &quot;MAPK14&quot; &quot;DAB2&quot; &quot;RAB25&quot; colnames(ht@matrix) ## [1] &quot;TCGA-05-4390-01&quot; &quot;TCGA-38-4631-01&quot; &quot;TCGA-44-6144-01&quot; &quot;TCGA-44-6145-01&quot; ## [5] &quot;TCGA-44-6146-01&quot; &quot;TCGA-49-4488-01&quot; &quot;TCGA-50-5930-01&quot; &quot;TCGA-50-5931-01&quot; ## [9] &quot;TCGA-50-5932-01&quot; &quot;TCGA-50-5933-01&quot; &quot;TCGA-50-5941-01&quot; &quot;TCGA-50-5942-01&quot; ## [13] &quot;TCGA-50-5944-01&quot; &quot;TCGA-50-5946-01&quot; &quot;TCGA-50-6591-01&quot; &quot;TCGA-50-6592-01&quot; ## [17] &quot;TCGA-50-6594-01&quot; &quot;TCGA-67-4679-01&quot; &quot;TCGA-67-6215-01&quot; &quot;TCGA-73-4658-01&quot; ## [21] &quot;TCGA-73-4676-01&quot; &quot;TCGA-75-5122-01&quot; &quot;TCGA-75-5125-01&quot; &quot;TCGA-75-5126-01&quot; ## [25] &quot;TCGA-75-6206-01&quot; &quot;TCGA-75-6211-01&quot; &quot;TCGA-86-6562-01&quot; &quot;TCGA-05-4396-01&quot; ## [29] &quot;TCGA-05-4405-01&quot; &quot;TCGA-05-4410-01&quot; &quot;TCGA-05-4415-01&quot; &quot;TCGA-05-4417-01&quot; ## [33] &quot;TCGA-05-4424-01&quot; &quot;TCGA-05-4427-01&quot; &quot;TCGA-05-4433-01&quot; &quot;TCGA-44-6774-01&quot; ## [37] &quot;TCGA-44-6775-01&quot; &quot;TCGA-44-6776-01&quot; &quot;TCGA-44-6777-01&quot; &quot;TCGA-44-6778-01&quot; ## [41] &quot;TCGA-49-4487-01&quot; &quot;TCGA-49-4490-01&quot; &quot;TCGA-49-6744-01&quot; &quot;TCGA-49-6745-01&quot; ## [45] &quot;TCGA-49-6767-01&quot; &quot;TCGA-50-5044-01&quot; &quot;TCGA-50-5051-01&quot; &quot;TCGA-50-5072-01&quot; ## [49] &quot;TCGA-50-6590-01&quot; &quot;TCGA-55-6642-01&quot; &quot;TCGA-55-6712-01&quot; &quot;TCGA-71-6725-01&quot; ## [53] &quot;TCGA-91-6828-01&quot; &quot;TCGA-91-6829-01&quot; &quot;TCGA-91-6835-01&quot; &quot;TCGA-91-6836-01&quot; ## [57] &quot;TCGA-35-3615-01&quot; &quot;TCGA-44-2655-01&quot; &quot;TCGA-44-2656-01&quot; &quot;TCGA-44-2662-01&quot; ## [61] &quot;TCGA-44-2666-01&quot; &quot;TCGA-44-2668-01&quot; &quot;TCGA-55-1592-01&quot; &quot;TCGA-55-1594-01&quot; ## [65] &quot;TCGA-55-1595-01&quot; &quot;TCGA-64-1676-01&quot; &quot;TCGA-64-1677-01&quot; &quot;TCGA-64-1678-01&quot; ## [69] &quot;TCGA-64-1680-01&quot; &quot;TCGA-67-3771-01&quot; &quot;TCGA-67-3773-01&quot; &quot;TCGA-67-3774-01&quot; ## [73] &quot;TCGA-05-4244-01&quot; &quot;TCGA-05-4249-01&quot; &quot;TCGA-05-4250-01&quot; &quot;TCGA-35-4122-01&quot; ## [77] &quot;TCGA-35-4123-01&quot; &quot;TCGA-44-2657-01&quot; &quot;TCGA-44-3398-01&quot; &quot;TCGA-44-3918-01&quot; ## [81] &quot;TCGA-05-4382-01&quot; &quot;TCGA-05-4389-01&quot; &quot;TCGA-05-4395-01&quot; &quot;TCGA-05-4397-01&quot; ## [85] &quot;TCGA-05-4398-01&quot; &quot;TCGA-05-4402-01&quot; &quot;TCGA-05-4403-01&quot; &quot;TCGA-05-4418-01&quot; ## [89] &quot;TCGA-05-4420-01&quot; &quot;TCGA-05-4422-01&quot; &quot;TCGA-05-4426-01&quot; &quot;TCGA-05-4430-01&quot; ## [93] &quot;TCGA-05-4434-01&quot; &quot;TCGA-38-4625-01&quot; &quot;TCGA-38-4626-01&quot; &quot;TCGA-38-4628-01&quot; ## [97] &quot;TCGA-38-4630-01&quot; &quot;TCGA-44-3396-01&quot; &quot;TCGA-49-4486-01&quot; &quot;TCGA-49-4505-01&quot; ## [101] &quot;TCGA-49-4506-01&quot; &quot;TCGA-49-4507-01&quot; &quot;TCGA-49-4510-01&quot; &quot;TCGA-73-4659-01&quot; ## [105] &quot;TCGA-73-4662-01&quot; &quot;TCGA-73-4668-01&quot; &quot;TCGA-73-4670-01&quot; &quot;TCGA-73-4677-01&quot; ## [109] &quot;TCGA-05-5428-01&quot; &quot;TCGA-05-5715-01&quot; &quot;TCGA-50-5045-01&quot; &quot;TCGA-50-5049-01&quot; ## [113] &quot;TCGA-50-5936-01&quot; &quot;TCGA-55-5899-01&quot; &quot;TCGA-64-5774-01&quot; &quot;TCGA-64-5775-01&quot; ## [117] &quot;TCGA-64-5778-01&quot; &quot;TCGA-64-5815-01&quot; &quot;TCGA-75-5146-01&quot; &quot;TCGA-75-5147-01&quot; ## [121] &quot;TCGA-80-5611-01&quot; "],

It is implemented in the UpSetR package in R. Here we re-implemented UpSet plots with the ComplexHeatmap package with some improvements. 8.1 Input data To represent multiple sets, the variable can be represented as: A list of sets where each set is a vector, e.g.: list(set1 = c(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;), set2 = c(&quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;, &quot;d&quot;, &quot;e&quot;), ...) A binary matrix/data frame where rows are elements and columns are sets, e.g.: set1 set2 set3 h 1 1 1 t 1 0 1 j 1 0 0 u 1 0 1 w 1 0 0 ... In the matrix, e.g., for row t, it means, t is in set set1, not in set set2, and in set set3. Note the matrix is also valid if it is a logical matrix. If the variable is a data frame, the binary columns (only contain 0 and 1) and the logical columns are only used. Both formats can be used for making UpSet plots, users can still use list_to_matrix() to convert from list to the binary matrix. lt = list(set1 = c(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;), set2 = c(&quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;, &quot;d&quot;, &quot;e&quot;)) list_to_matrix(lt) ## set1 set2 ## a 1 0 ## b 1 1 ## c 1 1 ## d 0 1 ## e 0 1 You can also set the universal set in list_to_matrix(): list_to_matrix(lt, universal = letters[1:10]) ## set1 set2 ## a 1 0 ## b 1 1 ## c 1 1 ## d 0 1 ## e 0 1 ## f 0 0 ## g 0 0 ## h 0 0 ## i 0 0 ## j 0 0 If the universal set does not completely cover the input sets, those elements are not in the universal set are removed: list_to_matrix(lt, universal = letters[1:4]) ## set1 set2 ## a 1 0 ## b 1 1 ## c 1 1 ## d 0 1 The set can be genomic intervals, then it can only be represented as a list of GRanges/IRanges objects. list(set1 = GRanges(...), set2 = GRanges(...), ...) 8.2 Mode E.g. for three sets (A, B, C), all combinations of selecting elements in the set or not in the set are encoded as following: A B C 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 A value of 1 means to select that set and 0 means not to select that set. E.g., 1 1 0 means to select set A, B while not set C. Note there is no 0 0 0, because the background set is not of interest here. In following part of this section, we refer A, B and C as sets and each combination as combination set. The whole binary matrix is called combination matrix. The UpSet plot visualizes the size of each combination set. With the binary code of each combination set, next we need to define how to calculate the size of that combination set. There are three modes: distinct mode: 1 means in that set and 0 means not in that set, then 1 1 0 means a set of elements both in set A and B, while not in C (setdiff(intersect(A, B), C)). Under this mode, the seven combination sets are the seven partitions in the Venn diagram and they are mutually exclusive. intersect mode: 1 means in that set and 0 is not taken into account, then, 1 1 0 means a set of elements in set A and B, and they can also in C or not in C (intersect(A, B)). Under this mode, the seven combination sets can overlap. union mode: 1 means in that set and 0 is not taken into account. When there are multiple 1, the relationship is OR. Then, 1 1 0 means a set of elements in set A or B, and they can also in C or not in C (union(A, B)). Under this mode, the seven combination sets can overlap. The three modes are illustrated in following figure: 8.3 Make the combination matrix The function make_comb_mat() generates the combination matrix as well as calculates the size of the sets and the combination sets. The input can be one single variable or name-value pairs: set.seed(123) lt = list(a = sample(letters, 5), b = sample(letters, 10), c = sample(letters, 15)) m1 = make_comb_mat(lt) m1 ## A combination matrix with 3 sets and 7 combinations. ## ranges of combination set size: c(1, 8). ## mode for the combination size: distinct. ## sets are on rows. ## ## Combination sets are: ## a b c code size ## x x x 111 2 ## x x 110 1 ## x x 101 1 ## x x 011 4 ## x 100 1 ## x 010 3 ## x 001 8 ## ## Sets are: ## set size ## a 5 ## b 10 ## c 15 m2 = make_comb_mat(a = lt$a, b = lt$b, c = lt$c) m3 = make_comb_mat(list_to_matrix(lt)) m1, m2 and m3 are identical. The mode is controlled by the mode argument: m1 = make_comb_mat(lt) # the default mode is `distinct` m2 = make_comb_mat(lt, mode = &quot;intersect&quot;) m3 = make_comb_mat(lt, mode = &quot;union&quot;) The UpSet plots under different modes will be demonstrated in later sections. When there are too many sets, the sets can be pre-filtered by the set sizes. The min_set_size and top_n_sets are for this purpose. min_set_size controls the minimal size for the sets and top_n_sets controls the number of top sets with the largest sizes. m1 = make_comb_mat(lt, min_set_size = 6) m2 = make_comb_mat(lt, top_n_sets = 2) The subsetting of the sets affects the calculation of the sizes of the combination sets, that is why it needs to be controlled at the combination matrix generation step. The subsetting of combination sets can be directly performed by subsetting the matrix: m = make_comb_mat(lt) m[1:4] ## A combination matrix with 3 sets and 4 combinations. ## ranges of combination set size: c(1, 4). ## mode for the combination size: distinct. ## sets are on rows. ## ## Combination sets are: ## a b c code size ## x x x 111 2 ## x x 110 1 ## x x 101 1 ## x x 011 4 ## ## Sets are: ## set size ## a 5 ## b 10 ## c 15 make_comb_mat() also allows to specify the universal set so that the complement set which contains elements not belonging to any set is also considered. m = make_comb_mat(lt, universal_set = letters) m ## A combination matrix with 3 sets and 8 combinations. ## ranges of combination set size: c(1, 8). ## mode for the combination size: distinct. ## sets are on rows. ## ## Combination sets are: ## a b c code size ## x x x 111 2 ## x x 110 1 ## x x 101 1 ## x x 011 4 ## x 100 1 ## x 010 3 ## x 001 8 ## 000 6 ## ## Sets are: ## set size ## a 5 ## b 10 ## c 15 ## complement 6 The universal set can be smaller than the union of all sets, then for each set, only the intersection to universal set is considered. m = make_comb_mat(lt, universal_set = letters[1:10]) m ## A combination matrix with 3 sets and 5 combinations. ## ranges of combination set size: c(1, 3). ## mode for the combination size: distinct. ## sets are on rows. ## ## Combination sets are: ## a b c code size ## x x 110 1 ## x x 101 1 ## x x 011 2 ## x 001 3 ## 000 3 ## ## Sets are: ## set size ## a 2 ## b 3 ## c 6 ## complement 3 If you already know the size of the complement size, you can directly set complement_size argument. m = make_comb_mat(lt, complement_size = 5) m ## A combination matrix with 3 sets and 8 combinations. ## ranges of combination set size: c(1, 8). ## mode for the combination size: distinct. ## sets are on rows. ## ## Combination sets are: ## a b c code size ## x x x 111 2 ## x x 110 1 ## x x 101 1 ## x x 011 4 ## x 100 1 ## x 010 3 ## x 001 8 ## 000 5 ## ## Sets are: ## set size ## a 5 ## b 10 ## c 15 ## complement 5 When the input is matrix and it contains elements that do not belong to any of the set, these elements are treated as complement set. x = list_to_matrix(lt, universal_set = letters) m = make_comb_mat(x) m ## A combination matrix with 3 sets and 8 combinations. ## ranges of combination set size: c(1, 8). ## mode for the combination size: distinct. ## sets are on rows. ## ## Combination sets are: ## a b c code size ## x x x 111 2 ## x x 110 1 ## x x 101 1 ## x x 011 4 ## x 100 1 ## x 010 3 ## x 001 8 ## 000 6 ## ## Sets are: ## set size ## a 5 ## b 10 ## c 15 ## complement 6 Next we demonstrate a second example, where the sets are genomic regions. When the sets are genomic regions, the size is calculated as the sum of the width of regions in each set (or in other words, the total number of base pairs). library(circlize) library(GenomicRanges) lt2 = lapply(1:4, function(i) generateRandomBed()) lt2 = lapply(lt2, function(df) GRanges(seqnames = df[, 1], ranges = IRanges(df[, 2], df[, 3]))) names(lt2) = letters[1:4] m2 = make_comb_mat(lt2) m2 ## A combination matrix with 4 sets and 15 combinations. ## ranges of combination set size: c(184941701, 199900416). ## mode for the combination size: distinct. ## sets are on rows. ## ## Top 8 combination sets are: ## a b c d code size ## x x 0011 199900416 ## x 1000 199756519 ## x x x 1011 198735008 ## x x x x 1111 197341532 ## x x x 1110 197137160 ## x x x 1101 194569926 ## x x 1001 194462988 ## x x 1010 192670258 ## ## Sets are: ## set size ## a 1566783009 ## b 1535968265 ## c 1560549760 ## d 1552480645 We don’t recommend to use the number of regions for the intersection of two sets of genomic regions. There are two reasons: 1. the value is not symmetric, i.e. the number of intersected regions measured in set1 is not always identical to the number of intersected regions measured in set2, thus, it is difficult to assign a value for the intersection between set1 and set2; 2. if one long region in set1 overlaps to another long region in set2, but only in a few base pairs, does it make sense to say these two regions are common in the two sets? The universal set also works for sets as genomic regions. 8.4 Utility functions make_comb_mat() returns a matrix, also in comb_mat class. There are some utility functions that can be applied to this comb_mat object: set_name(): The set names. comb_name(): The combination set names. The names of the combination sets are formatted as a string of binary bits. E.g. for three sets of A, B, C, the combination set with name “101” corresponds to selecting set A, not selecting set B and selecting set C. set_size(): The set sizes. comb_size(): The combination set sizes. comb_degree(): The degree for a combination set is the number of sets that are selected. t(): Transpose the combination matrix. By default make_comb_mat() generates a matrix where sets are on rows and combination sets are on columns, and so are they on the UpSet plots. By transposing the combination matrix, the position of sets and combination sets can be swtiched on the UpSet plot. extract_comb(): Extract the elements in a specified combination set. The usage will be explained later. Functions for subsetting the matrix. Quick examples are: m = make_comb_mat(lt) set_name(m) ## [1] &quot;a&quot; &quot;b&quot; &quot;c&quot; comb_name(m) ## [1] &quot;111&quot; &quot;110&quot; &quot;101&quot; &quot;011&quot; &quot;100&quot; &quot;010&quot; &quot;001&quot; set_size(m) ## a b c ## 5 10 15 comb_size(m) ## 111 110 101 011 100 010 001 ## 2 1 1 4 1 3 8 comb_degree(m) ## 111 110 101 011 100 010 001 ## 3 2 2 2 1 1 1 t(m) ## A combination matrix with 3 sets and 7 combinations. ## ranges of combination set size: c(1, 8). ## mode for the combination size: distinct. ## sets are on columns ## ## Combination sets are: ## a b c code size ## x x x 111 2 ## x x 110 1 ## x x 101 1 ## x x 011 4 ## x 100 1 ## x 010 3 ## x 001 8 ## ## Sets are: ## set size ## a 5 ## b 10 ## c 15 For using extract_comb(), the valid combination set name should be from comb_name(). Note the elements in the combination sets depends on the “mode” set in make_comb_mat(). extract_comb(m, &quot;101&quot;) ## [1] &quot;j&quot; And the example for sets that are the genomic regions: # `lt2` was generated in the previous section m2 = make_comb_mat(lt2) set_size(m2) ## a b c d ## 1566783009 1535968265 1560549760 1552480645 comb_size(m2) ## 1111 1110 1101 1011 0111 1100 1010 1001 ## 197341532 197137160 194569926 198735008 191312455 192109618 192670258 194462988 ## 0110 0101 0011 1000 0100 0010 0001 ## 191359036 184941701 199900416 199756519 187196837 192093895 191216619 And now extract_comb() returns genomic regions that are in the corresponding combination set. extract_comb(m2, &quot;1010&quot;) ## GRanges object with 5063 ranges and 0 metadata columns: ## seqnames ranges strand ## &lt;Rle&gt; &lt;IRanges&gt; &lt;Rle&gt; ## [1] chr1 255644-258083 * ## [2] chr1 306114-308971 * ## [3] chr1 1267493-1360170 * ## [4] chr1 2661311-2665736 * ## [5] chr1 3020553-3030645 * ## ... ... ... ... ## [5059] chrY 56286079-56286864 * ## [5060] chrY 57049541-57078332 * ## [5061] chrY 58691055-58699756 * ## [5062] chrY 58705675-58716954 * ## [5063] chrY 58765097-58776696 * ## ------- ## seqinfo: 24 sequences from an unspecified genome; no seqlengths With comb_size() and comb_degree(), we can filter the combination matrix as: m = make_comb_mat(lt) # combination set size &gt;= 4 m[comb_size(m) &gt;= 4] ## A combination matrix with 3 sets and 2 combinations. ## ranges of combination set size: c(4, 8). ## mode for the combination size: distinct. ## sets are on rows. ## ## Combination sets are: ## a b c code size ## x x 011 4 ## x 001 8 ## ## Sets are: ## set size ## a 5 ## b 10 ## c 15 # combination set degree == 2 m[comb_degree(m) == 2] ## A combination matrix with 3 sets and 3 combinations. ## ranges of combination set size: c(1, 4). ## mode for the combination size: distinct. ## sets are on rows. ## ## Combination sets are: ## a b c code size ## x x 110 1 ## x x 101 1 ## x x 011 4 ## ## Sets are: ## set size ## a 5 ## b 10 ## c 15 For the complement set, the name for this special combination set is only composed of zeros. m2 = make_comb_mat(lt, universal_set = letters) comb_name(m2) # see the first element ## [1] &quot;111&quot; &quot;110&quot; &quot;101&quot; &quot;011&quot; &quot;100&quot; &quot;010&quot; &quot;001&quot; &quot;000&quot; comb_degree(m2) ## 111 110 101 011 100 010 001 000 ## 3 2 2 2 1 1 1 0 If universal_set was set in make_comb_mat(), extract_comb() can be applied to the complement set. m2 = make_comb_mat(lt, universal_set = letters) extract_comb(m2, &quot;000&quot;) ## [1] &quot;a&quot; &quot;b&quot; &quot;f&quot; &quot;p&quot; &quot;u&quot; &quot;z&quot; m2 = make_comb_mat(lt, universal_set = letters[1:10]) extract_comb(m2, &quot;000&quot;) ## [1] &quot;a&quot; &quot;b&quot; &quot;f&quot; When universal_set was set, extract_comb() also works for genomic region sets. In previous examples, we demonstrated using “one-dimensional index” such as: m[comb_degree(m) == 2] Since the combination matrix is natually a matrix, the indices can also be applied to the both dimensions. In the default settings, sets are on the rows and combination sets are on the columns, thus, indices on the first dimension of the matrix correspond to sets and indices on the second dimension correspond to combination sets: # by set names m[c(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;), ] # by nummeric indicies m[3:1, ] New empty sets can be added to the combination matrix by: # `d` is the new empty set m[c(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;, &quot;d&quot;), ] Note when the indices specified do not cover all non-empty sets in the original combination matrix, the combination matrix will be re-calculated because it affects the values in the combination sets: # if `c` is a non-empty set m[c(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;),] Similar for subsetting on the second dimension which correspond to the combination sets: # reorder m[, 5:1] # take a subset m[, 1:3] # by charater indices m[, c(&quot;110&quot;, &quot;101&quot;, &quot;011&quot;)] New empty combination sets can also be added by setting the character indices: m[m, c(comb_name(m), &quot;100&quot;)] Indices can be set on both dimension simultaneously only when the set indices covers all non-empty sets: m[3:1, 5:1] # this will throw an error because `c` is a non-empty set m[c(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;), 5:1] If the combination matrix was transposed, the margin of the matrix where set indices and combination set indices should be switched. tm = t(m) tm[reverse(comb_name(tm)), reverse(set_name(tm))] If only the indices for the combination sets are set as one-dimensional, it automatically works for both matrices that are transposed or not: m[1:5] tm[1:5] 8.5 Make the plot Making the UpSet plot is very straightforward that users just send the combination matrix to UpSet() function: m = make_comb_mat(lt) UpSet(m) By default the sets are ordered by the size and the combination sets are ordered by the degree (number of sets that are selected). The order is controlled by set_order and comb_order: UpSet(m, set_order = c(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;), comb_order = order(comb_size(m))) Color of dots, size of dots and line width of the segments are controlled by pt_size, comb_col and lwd. comb_col should be a vector corresponding to the combination sets. In following code, since comb_degree(m) returns a vector of integers, we just use it as index for the color vector. UpSet(m, pt_size = unit(5, &quot;mm&quot;), lwd = 3, comb_col = c(&quot;red&quot;, &quot;blue&quot;, &quot;black&quot;)[comb_degree(m)]) Colors for the background (the rectangles and the dots representing the set is not selected) are controlled by bg_col, bg_pt_col. The length of bg_col can have length of one or two. UpSet(m, comb_col = &quot;#0000FF&quot;, bg_col = &quot;#F0F0FF&quot;, bg_pt_col = &quot;#CCCCFF&quot;) UpSet(m, comb_col = &quot;#0000FF&quot;, bg_col = c(&quot;#F0F0FF&quot;, &quot;#FFF0F0&quot;), bg_pt_col = &quot;#CCCCFF&quot;) Transposing the combination matrix swtiches the sets to columns and combination sets to rows. UpSet(t(m)) As we have introduced, if do subsetting on the combination sets, the subset of the matrix can be visualized as well: UpSet(m[comb_size(m) &gt;= 4]) UpSet(m[comb_degree(m) == 2]) Following compares the different mode in make_comb_mat(): m1 = make_comb_mat(lt) # the default mode is `distinct` m2 = make_comb_mat(lt, mode = &quot;intersect&quot;) m3 = make_comb_mat(lt, mode = &quot;union&quot;) UpSet(m1) UpSet(m2) UpSet(m3) For the plot containing complement set, there is one additional column showing this complement set does not overlap to any of the sets (all dots are in grey). m2 = make_comb_mat(lt, universal_set = letters) UpSet(m2) Remember if you already know the size for the complement set, you can directly assign it by complement_size argument in make_comb_mat(). m2 = make_comb_mat(lt, complement_size = 10) UpSet(m2) For the case where the universal set is smaller than the union of all sets: m2 = make_comb_mat(lt, universal_set = letters[1:10]) UpSet(m2) There are some cases that you may have complement set but you don’t want to show it, especially when the input for make_comb_mat() is a matrix which already contains complement set, you can filter by the combination degrees. x = list_to_matrix(lt, universal_set = letters) m2 = make_comb_mat(x) m2 = m2[comb_degree(m2) &gt; 0] UpSet(m2) 8.6 UpSet plots as heatmaps In the UpSet plot, the major component is the combination matrix, and on the two sides are the barplots representing the size of sets and the combination sets, thus, it is quite straightforward to implement it as a “heatmap” where the heatmap is self-defined with dots and segments, and the two barplots are two barplot annotations constructed by anno_barplot(). The default top annotation is: HeatmapAnnotation(&quot;Intersection\\nsize&quot; = anno_barplot(comb_size(m), border = FALSE, gp = gpar(fill = &quot;black&quot;), height = unit(3, &quot;cm&quot;)), annotation_name_side = &quot;left&quot;, annotation_name_rot = 0) This top annotation is wrapped in upset_top_annotation() which only contais the upset top barplot annotation. Most of the arguments in upset_top_annotation() directly go to the anno_barplot(), e.g. to set the colors of bars: UpSet(m, top_annotation = upset_top_annotation(m, gp = gpar(col = comb_degree(m)))) To control the data range and axis: UpSet(m, top_annotation = upset_top_annotation(m, ylim = c(0, 15), bar_width = 1, axis_param = list(side = &quot;right&quot;, at = c(0, 5, 10, 15), labels = c(&quot;zero&quot;, &quot;five&quot;, &quot;ten&quot;, &quot;fifteen&quot;)))) To control the annotation name: UpSet(m, top_annotation = upset_top_annotation(m, annotation_name_rot = 90, annotation_name_side = &quot;right&quot;, axis_param = list(side = &quot;right&quot;))) The settings are very similar for the right annotation: UpSet(m, right_annotation = upset_right_annotation(m, ylim = c(0, 30), gp = gpar(fill = &quot;green&quot;), annotation_name_side = &quot;top&quot;, axis_param = list(side = &quot;top&quot;))) upset_top_annotation() and upset_right_annotation() can automatically recognize whether sets are on rows or columns. upset_top_annotation() and upset_right_annotation() only contain one barplot annotation. If users want to add more annotations, they need to manually construct a HeatmapAnnotation object with multiple annotations. To add more annotations on top: UpSet(m, top_annotation = HeatmapAnnotation( degree = as.character(comb_degree(m)), &quot;Intersection\\nsize&quot; = anno_barplot(comb_size(m), border = FALSE, gp = gpar(fill = &quot;black&quot;), height = unit(2, &quot;cm&quot;) ), annotation_name_side = &quot;left&quot;, annotation_name_rot = 0)) To add more annotation on the right: UpSet(m, right_annotation = rowAnnotation( &quot;Set size&quot; = anno_barplot(set_size(m), border = FALSE, gp = gpar(fill = &quot;black&quot;), width = unit(2, &quot;cm&quot;) ), group = c(&quot;group1&quot;, &quot;group1&quot;, &quot;group2&quot;))) To move the right annotation to the left of the combination matrix: UpSet(m, left_annotation = rowAnnotation( &quot;Set size&quot; = anno_barplot(set_size(m), border = FALSE, gp = gpar(fill = &quot;black&quot;), width = unit(2, &quot;cm&quot;) )), right_annotation = NULL) To reverse the axis of the left annotation: UpSet(m, left_annotation = rowAnnotation( &quot;Set size&quot; = anno_barplot(set_size(m), axis_param = list(direction = &quot;reverse&quot;), border = FALSE, gp = gpar(fill = &quot;black&quot;), width = unit(2, &quot;cm&quot;) )), right_annotation = NULL, row_names_side = &quot;right&quot;) The object returned by UpSet() is actually a Heatmap class object, thus, you can add to other heatmaps and annotations by + or %v%. ht = UpSet(m) class(ht) ## [1] &quot;Heatmap&quot; ## attr(,&quot;package&quot;) ## [1] &quot;ComplexHeatmap&quot; ht + Heatmap(1:3, name = &quot;foo&quot;, width = unit(5, &quot;mm&quot;)) + rowAnnotation(bar = anno_points(1:3)) ht %v% Heatmap(rbind(1:7), name = &quot;foo&quot;, row_names_side = &quot;left&quot;, height = unit(5, &quot;mm&quot;)) %v% HeatmapAnnotation(bar = anno_points(1:7), annotation_name_side = &quot;left&quot;) Add multiple UpSet plots: m1 = make_comb_mat(lt, mode = &quot;distinct&quot;) m2 = make_comb_mat(lt, mode = &quot;intersect&quot;) m3 = make_comb_mat(lt, mode = &quot;union&quot;) UpSet(m1, row_title = &quot;distinct mode&quot;) %v% UpSet(m2, row_title = &quot;intersect mode&quot;) %v% UpSet(m3, row_title = &quot;union mode&quot;) Or first transpose all the combination matrices and add them horizontally: m1 = make_comb_mat(lt, mode = &quot;distinct&quot;) m2 = make_comb_mat(lt, mode = &quot;intersect&quot;) m3 = make_comb_mat(lt, mode = &quot;union&quot;) UpSet(t(m1), column_title = &quot;distinct mode&quot;) + UpSet(t(m2), column_title = &quot;intersect mode&quot;) + UpSet(t(m3), column_title = &quot;union mode&quot;) The three combination matrices are actually the same and plotting them three times is redundant. With the functionality in ComplexHeatmap package, we can directly add three barplot annotations. top_ha = HeatmapAnnotation( &quot;distict&quot; = anno_barplot(comb_size(m1), gp = gpar(fill = &quot;black&quot;), height = unit(2, &quot;cm&quot;)), &quot;intersect&quot; = anno_barplot(comb_size(m2), gp = gpar(fill = &quot;black&quot;), height = unit(2, &quot;cm&quot;)), &quot;union&quot; = anno_barplot(comb_size(m3), gp = gpar(fill = &quot;black&quot;), height = unit(2, &quot;cm&quot;)), gap = unit(2, &quot;mm&quot;), annotation_name_side = &quot;left&quot;, annotation_name_rot = 0) # the same for using m2 or m3 UpSet(m1, top_annotation = top_ha) Similar when the combination matrix is transposed: right_ha = rowAnnotation( &quot;distict&quot; = anno_barplot(comb_size(m1), gp = gpar(fill = &quot;black&quot;), width = unit(2, &quot;cm&quot;)), &quot;intersect&quot; = anno_barplot(comb_size(m2), gp = gpar(fill = &quot;black&quot;), width = unit(2, &quot;cm&quot;)), &quot;union&quot; = anno_barplot(comb_size(m3), gp = gpar(fill = &quot;black&quot;), width = unit(2, &quot;cm&quot;)), gap = unit(2, &quot;mm&quot;), annotation_name_side = &quot;bottom&quot;) # the same for using m2 or m3 UpSet(t(m1), right_annotation = right_ha) In the origial UpSet implementation, the combination set sizes are also drawn on top of the barplots. Here, we don’t directly support it, but the sizes can be manually added by decorate_annotation() function. See following example: ht = draw(UpSet(m)) od = column_order(ht) cs = comb_size(m) decorate_annotation(&quot;Intersection\\nsize&quot;, { grid.text(cs[od], x = seq_along(cs), y = unit(cs[od], &quot;native&quot;) + unit(2, &quot;pt&quot;), default.units = &quot;native&quot;, just = &quot;bottom&quot;, gp = gpar(fontsize = 8)) }) There are several reasons that we don’t directly supported add the combination set size to the plot: 1. Add new text means to add several new arguments to the function, e.g., the arguments for graphic parameters, the rotations, the positions, the margin to the bars, which will make the function heavy. 2. Need to properly calculate the ylim for the barplot annotation to let the text not exceed the annotation region. 3. Using decoration_annotation() is more flexible to use that not only the size but also customized text can be added. 8.7 Example with the movies dataset UpsetR package also provides a movies dataset, which contains 17 genres for 3883 movies. First load the dataset. movies = read.csv(system.file(&quot;extdata&quot;, &quot;movies.csv&quot;, package = &quot;UpSetR&quot;), header = TRUE, sep = &quot;;&quot;) head(movies) # `make_comb_mat()` automatically ignores the first two columns ## Name ReleaseDate Action Adventure Children ## 1 Toy Story (1995) 1995 0 0 1 ## 2 Jumanji (1995) 1995 0 1 1 ## 3 Grumpier Old Men (1995) 1995 0 0 0 ## 4 Waiting to Exhale (1995) 1995 0 0 0 ## 5 Father of the Bride Part II (1995) 1995 0 0 0 ## 6 Heat (1995) 1995 1 0 0 ## Comedy Crime Documentary Drama Fantasy Noir Horror Musical Mystery Romance ## 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ## 2 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 ## 3 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 ## 4 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 ## 5 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ## 6 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ## SciFi Thriller War Western AvgRating Watches ## 1 0 0 0 0 4.15 2077 ## 2 0 0 0 0 3.20 701 ## 3 0 0 0 0 3.02 478 ## 4 0 0 0 0 2.73 170 ## 5 0 0 0 0 3.01 296 ## 6 0 1 0 0 3.88 940 To make a same UpSet plot as in this vignette: m = make_comb_mat(movies, top_n_sets = 6) m ## A combination matrix with 6 sets and 39 combinations. ## ranges of combination set size: c(1, 1028). ## mode for the combination size: distinct. ## sets are on rows. ## ## Top 8 combination sets are: ## Action Comedy Drama Horror Romance Thriller code size ## x 001000 1028 ## x 010000 698 ## x 000100 216 ## x 100000 206 ## x 000001 183 ## x x 011000 180 ## x x 010010 160 ## x x 001010 158 ## ## Sets are: ## set size ## Action 503 ## Comedy 1200 ## Drama 1603 ## Horror 343 ## Romance 471 ## Thriller 492 ## complement 2 m = m[comb_degree(m) &gt; 0] UpSet(m) Following code makes it look more similar as the orignal plot. The code is a little bit long, but most of the code mainly customize the annotations and row/column orders. ss = set_size(m) cs = comb_size(m) ht = UpSet(m, set_order = order(ss), comb_order = order(comb_degree(m), -cs), top_annotation = HeatmapAnnotation( &quot;Genre Intersections&quot; = anno_barplot(cs, ylim = c(0, max(cs)*1.1), border = FALSE, gp = gpar(fill = &quot;black&quot;), height = unit(4, &quot;cm&quot;) ), annotation_name_side = &quot;left&quot;, annotation_name_rot = 90), left_annotation = rowAnnotation( &quot;Movies Per Genre&quot; = anno_barplot(-ss, baseline = 0, axis_param = list( at = c(0, -500, -1000, -1500), labels = c(0, 500, 1000, 1500), labels_rot = 0), border = FALSE, gp = gpar(fill = &quot;black&quot;), width = unit(4, &quot;cm&quot;) ), set_name = anno_text(set_name(m), location = 0.5, just = &quot;center&quot;, width = max_text_width(set_name(m)) + unit(4, &quot;mm&quot;)) ), right_annotation = NULL, show_row_names = FALSE) ht = draw(ht) od = column_order(ht) decorate_annotation(&quot;Genre Intersections&quot;, { grid.text(cs[od], x = seq_along(cs), y = unit(cs[od], &quot;native&quot;) + unit(2, &quot;pt&quot;), default.units = &quot;native&quot;, just = c(&quot;left&quot;, &quot;bottom&quot;), gp = gpar(fontsize = 6, col = &quot;#404040&quot;), rot = 45) }) In movies dataset, there is also one column AvgRating which gives the rating of each movie, we next split all the movies into five groups based on the ratings. genre = c(&quot;Action&quot;, &quot;Romance&quot;, &quot;Horror&quot;, &quot;Children&quot;, &quot;SciFi&quot;, &quot;Documentary&quot;) rating = cut(movies$AvgRating, c(0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)) m_list = tapply(seq_len(nrow(movies)), rating, function(ind) { m = make_comb_mat(movies[ind, genre, drop = FALSE]) m[comb_degree(m) &gt; 0] }) The combination matrices in m_list might have different combination sets: sapply(m_list, comb_size) ## $`(0,1]` ## 010000 001000 000100 000001 ## 1 2 1 1 ## ## $`(1,2]` ## 101010 100110 110000 101000 100100 100010 001010 100000 010000 001000 000100 ## 1 1 1 4 5 5 8 14 7 38 14 ## 000010 000001 ## 3 2 ## ## $`(2,3]` ## 101010 110000 101000 100100 100010 010100 010010 001010 000110 100000 010000 ## 4 8 2 6 35 3 1 27 7 126 99 ## 001000 000100 000010 000001 ## 142 77 27 9 ## ## $`(3,4]` ## 110010 101010 100110 110000 101000 100010 011000 010100 010010 001100 001010 ## 1 6 1 20 6 45 3 4 4 1 11 ## 000110 100000 010000 001000 000100 000010 000001 ## 5 176 276 82 122 66 87 ## ## $`(4,5]` ## 110010 101010 110000 101000 100010 100000 010000 001000 000100 000010 000001 ## 1 1 4 1 6 23 38 4 4 10 28 To compare between multiple groups with UpSet plots, we need to normalize all the matrices to make them have same sets and same combination sets. normalize_comb_mat() basically adds zero to the new combination sets which were not there before. m_list = normalize_comb_mat(m_list) sapply(m_list, comb_size) ## (0,1] (1,2] (2,3] (3,4] (4,5] ## 110001 0 1 0 1 0 ## 100101 0 1 4 6 1 ## 100011 0 0 0 1 1 ## 110000 0 5 6 0 0 ## 100100 0 4 2 6 1 ## 100010 0 1 8 20 4 ## 100001 0 5 35 45 6 ## 010100 0 0 0 1 0 ## 010010 0 0 3 4 0 ## 010001 0 0 7 5 0 ## 000110 0 0 0 3 0 ## 000101 0 8 27 11 0 ## 000011 0 0 1 4 0 ## 100000 0 14 126 176 23 ## 010000 1 14 77 122 4 ## 001000 1 2 9 87 28 ## 000100 2 38 142 82 4 ## 000010 1 7 99 276 38 ## 000001 0 3 27 66 10 We calculate the range for the two barplots: max_set_size = max(sapply(m_list, set_size)) max_comb_size = max(sapply(m_list, comb_size)) And finally we add the five UpSet plots vertically: ht_list = NULL for(i in seq_along(m_list)) { ht_list = ht_list %v% UpSet(m_list[[i]], row_title = paste0(&quot;rating in&quot;, names(m_list)[i]), set_order = NULL, comb_order = NULL, top_annotation = upset_top_annotation(m_list[[i]], ylim = c(0, max_comb_size)), right_annotation = upset_right_annotation(m_list[[i]], ylim = c(0, max_set_size))) } ht_list After comparing the five UpSet plots, we can see most of the movies are rated between 2 and 4. Horror movies tend to have lower ratings and romance movies tend to have higher ratings. Instead of directly comparing the size of the combination sets, we can also compare the relative fraction to the full sets. In following code, we remove the group of c(0, 1] because the number of movies are too few there. m_list = m_list[-1] max_set_size = max(sapply(m_list, set_size)) rel_comb_size = sapply(m_list, function(m) { s = comb_size(m) # because the combination matrix is generated under &quot;distinct&quot; mode # the sum of `s` is the size of the full set s/sum(s) }) ht_list = NULL for(i in seq_along(m_list)) { ht_list = ht_list %v% UpSet(m_list[[i]], row_title = paste0(&quot;rating in&quot;, names(m_list)[i]), set_order = NULL, comb_order = NULL, top_annotation = HeatmapAnnotation( &quot;Relative\\nfraction&quot; = anno_barplot( rel_comb_size[, i], ylim = c(0, 0.5), gp = gpar(fill = &quot;black&quot;), border = FALSE, height = unit(2, &quot;cm&quot;), ), annotation_name_side = &quot;left&quot;, annotation_name_rot = 0), right_annotation = upset_right_annotation(m_list[[i]], ylim = c(0, max_set_size)) ) } ht_list Now the trend is more clear that horror movies are rated low and documentaries are rated high. Next we split the movies by years: year = floor(movies$ReleaseDate/10)*10 m_list = tapply(seq_len(nrow(movies)), year, function(ind) { m = make_comb_mat(movies[ind, genre, drop = FALSE]) m[comb_degree(m) &gt; 0] }) m_list = normalize_comb_mat(m_list) max_set_size = max(sapply(m_list, set_size)) max_comb_size = max(sapply(m_list, comb_size)) ht_list1 = NULL for(i in 1:5) { ht_list1 = ht_list1 %v% UpSet(m_list[[i]], row_title = paste0(names(m_list)[i], &quot;s&quot;), set_order = NULL, comb_order = NULL, top_annotation = upset_top_annotation(m_list[[i]], ylim = c(0, max_comb_size), height = unit(2, &quot;cm&quot;)), right_annotation = upset_right_annotation(m_list[[i]], ylim = c(0, max_set_size))) } ht_list2 = NULL for(i in 6:10) { ht_list2 = ht_list2 %v% UpSet(m_list[[i]], row_title = paste0(names(m_list)[i], &quot;s&quot;), set_order = NULL, comb_order = NULL, top_annotation = upset_top_annotation(m_list[[i]], ylim = c(0, max_comb_size), height = unit(2, &quot;cm&quot;)), right_annotation = upset_right_annotation(m_list[[i]], ylim = c(0, max_set_size))) } grid.newpage() pushViewport(viewport(x = 0, width = 0.5, just = &quot;left&quot;)) draw(ht_list1, newpage = FALSE) popViewport() pushViewport(viewport(x = 0.5, width = 0.5, just = &quot;left&quot;)) draw(ht_list2, newpage = FALSE) popViewport() Now we can see most of the movies were produces in 1990s and the two major genres are actions and romance. Similarly, if we change the top annotation to the relative fraction to the full sets (code not shown): Finally we can add the statistics of years, ratings and number of watches for each combination set as boxplot annotations to the right of the UpSet plot. m = make_comb_mat(movies[, genre]) m = m[comb_degree(m) &gt; 0] comb_elements = lapply(comb_name(m), function(nm) extract_comb(m, nm)) years = lapply(comb_elements, function(ind) movies$ReleaseDate[ind]) rating = lapply(comb_elements, function(ind) movies$AvgRating[ind]) watches = lapply(comb_elements, function(ind) movies$Watches[ind]) UpSet(t(m)) + rowAnnotation(years = anno_boxplot(years), rating = anno_boxplot(rating), watches = anno_boxplot(watches), gap = unit(2, &quot;mm&quot;)) We can see the movies with genre “Scifi + Children” were produced quite old but the ratings are not bad. The movies with genre “Action + Children” have the lowest ratings. 8.8 Example with the genomic regions The H3K4me3 ChIP-seq peaks from six Roadmap samples are visualized by UpSet plot. The six samples are: ESC, E016 ES-derived, E004 ES-derived, E006 Brain, E071 Muscle, E100 Heart, E104 First read the files and convert to GRanges objects. file_list = c( &quot;ESC&quot; = &quot;data/E016-H3K4me3.narrowPeak.gz&quot;, &quot;ES-deriv1&quot; = &quot;data/E004-H3K4me3.narrowPeak.gz&quot;, &quot;ES-deriv2&quot; = &quot;data/E006-H3K4me3.narrowPeak.gz&quot;, &quot;Brain&quot; = &quot;data/E071-H3K4me3.narrowPeak.gz&quot;, &quot;Muscle&quot; = &quot;data/E100-H3K4me3.narrowPeak.gz&quot;, &quot;Heart&quot; = &quot;data/E104-H3K4me3.narrowPeak.gz&quot; ) library(GenomicRanges) peak_list = lapply(file_list, function(f) { df = read.table(f) GRanges(seqnames = df[, 1], ranges = IRanges(df[, 2], df [, 3])) }) Make the combination matrix. Note now the size of the sets and the combination sets are total base pairs or the sum of width of the regions. We only keep the combination sets with more than 500kb. m = make_comb_mat(peak_list) m = m[comb_size(m) &gt; 500000] UpSet(m) We can nicely format the axis labels by setting axis_param: UpSet(m, top_annotation = upset_top_annotation( m, axis_param = list(at = c(0, 1e7, 2e7), labels = c(&quot;0MB&quot;, &quot;10MB&quot;, &quot;20MB&quot;)), height = unit(4, &quot;cm&quot;) ), right_annotation = upset_right_annotation( m, axis_param = list(at = c(0, 2e7, 4e7, 6e7), labels = c(&quot;0MB&quot;, &quot;20MB&quot;, &quot;40MB&quot;, &quot;60MB&quot;), labels_rot = 0), width = unit(4, &quot;cm&quot;) )) With each set of genomic regions, we can associate more information to it, such as the mean methylation or the distance to nearest TSS. subgroup = c(&quot;ESC&quot; = &quot;group1&quot;, &quot;ES-deriv1&quot; = &quot;group1&quot;, &quot;ES-deriv2&quot; = &quot;group1&quot;, &quot;Brain&quot; = &quot;group2&quot;, &quot;Muscle&quot; = &quot;group2&quot;, &quot;Heart&quot; = &quot;group2&quot; ) comb_sets = lapply(comb_name(m), function(nm) extract_comb(m, nm)) comb_sets = lapply(comb_sets, function(gr) { # we just randomly generate dist_to_tss and mean_meth gr$dist_to_tss = abs(rnorm(length(gr), mean = runif(1, min = 500, max = 2000), sd = 1000)) gr$mean_meth = abs(rnorm(length(gr), mean = 0.1, sd = 0.1)) gr }) UpSet(m, top_annotation = upset_top_annotation( m, axis_param = list(at = c(0, 1e7, 2e7), labels = c(&quot;0MB&quot;, &quot;10MB&quot;, &quot;20MB&quot;)), height = unit(4, &quot;cm&quot;) ), right_annotation = upset_right_annotation( m, axis_param = list(at = c(0, 2e7, 4e7, 6e7), labels = c(&quot;0MB&quot;, &quot;20MB&quot;, &quot;40MB&quot;, &quot;60MB&quot;), labels_rot = 0), width = unit(4, &quot;cm&quot;) ), left_annotation = rowAnnotation(group = subgroup[set_name(m)], show_annotation_name = FALSE), bottom_annotation = HeatmapAnnotation( dist_to_tss = anno_boxplot(lapply(comb_sets, function(gr) gr$dist_to_tss), outline = FALSE), mean_meth = sapply(comb_sets, function(gr) mean(gr$mean_meth)), annotation_name_side = &quot;left&quot; ) ) "],

Rows in the matrix correspond to genes and more information on these genes can be attached after the expression heatmap. In following example, the big heatmap visualizes relative expression for genes (expression for each gene is scaled). On the right we put the absolute expression level of genes as a single-column heatmap. The gene length and gene type (i.e. protein coding or lincRNA) are also put as heatmap annotations or heatmaps. On the very left of the heatmaps, there are colored rectangles drawn by anno_block() to identify the five clusters from k-means clustering. On top of the “base mean” and “gene type” heatmaps, there are summary plots (barplots and boxplots) showing the statistics or distributions of the data points in the five clusters. library(ComplexHeatmap) library(circlize) expr = readRDS(system.file(package = &quot;ComplexHeatmap&quot;, &quot;extdata&quot;, &quot;gene_expression.rds&quot;)) mat = as.matrix(expr[, grep(&quot;cell&quot;, colnames(expr))]) base_mean = rowMeans(mat) mat_scaled = t(apply(mat, 1, scale)) type = gsub(&quot;s\\\\d+_&quot;, &quot;&quot;, colnames(mat)) ha = HeatmapAnnotation(type = type, annotation_name_side = &quot;left&quot;) ht_list = Heatmap(mat_scaled, name = &quot;expression&quot;, row_km = 5, col = colorRamp2(c(-2, 0, 2), c(&quot;green&quot;, &quot;white&quot;, &quot;red&quot;)), top_annotation = ha, show_column_names = FALSE, row_title = NULL, show_row_dend = FALSE) + Heatmap(base_mean, name = &quot;base mean&quot;, top_annotation = HeatmapAnnotation(summary = anno_summary(gp = gpar(fill = 2:6), height = unit(2, &quot;cm&quot;))), width = unit(15, &quot;mm&quot;)) + rowAnnotation(length = anno_points(expr$length, pch = 16, size = unit(1, &quot;mm&quot;), axis_param = list(at = c(0, 2e5, 4e5, 6e5), labels = c(&quot;0kb&quot;, &quot;200kb&quot;, &quot;400kb&quot;, &quot;600kb&quot;)), width = unit(2, &quot;cm&quot;))) + Heatmap(expr$type, name = &quot;gene type&quot;, top_annotation = HeatmapAnnotation(summary = anno_summary(height = unit(2, &quot;cm&quot;))), width = unit(15, &quot;mm&quot;)) ht_list = rowAnnotation(block = anno_block(gp = gpar(fill = 2:6, col = NA)), width = unit(2, &quot;mm&quot;)) + ht_list draw(ht_list, ht_gap = unit(5, &quot;mm&quot;)) 9.2 The measles vaccine heatmap Following code reproduces the heatmap introduced here and here. mat = readRDS(system.file(&quot;extdata&quot;, &quot;measles.rds&quot;, package = &quot;ComplexHeatmap&quot;)) ha1 = HeatmapAnnotation( dist1 = anno_barplot( colSums(mat), bar_width = 1, gp = gpar(col = &quot;white&quot;, fill = &quot;#FFE200&quot;), border = FALSE, axis_param = list(at = c(0, 2e5, 4e5, 6e5, 8e5), labels = c(&quot;0&quot;, &quot;200k&quot;, &quot;400k&quot;, &quot;600k&quot;, &quot;800k&quot;)), height = unit(2, &quot;cm&quot;) ), show_annotation_name = FALSE) ha2 = rowAnnotation( dist2 = anno_barplot( rowSums(mat), bar_width = 1, gp = gpar(col = &quot;white&quot;, fill = &quot;#FFE200&quot;), border = FALSE, axis_param = list(at = c(0, 5e5, 1e6, 1.5e6), labels = c(&quot;0&quot;, &quot;500k&quot;, &quot;1m&quot;, &quot;1.5m&quot;)), width = unit(2, &quot;cm&quot;) ), show_annotation_name = FALSE) year_text = as.numeric(colnames(mat)) year_text[year_text %% 10 != 0] = &quot;&quot; ha_column = HeatmapAnnotation( year = anno_text(year_text, rot = 0, location = unit(1, &quot;npc&quot;), just = &quot;top&quot;) ) col_fun = colorRamp2(c(0, 800, 1000, 127000), c(&quot;white&quot;, &quot;cornflowerblue&quot;, &quot;yellow&quot;, &quot;red&quot;)) ht_list = Heatmap(mat, name = &quot;cases&quot;, col = col_fun, cluster_columns = FALSE, show_row_dend = FALSE, rect_gp = gpar(col= &quot;white&quot;), show_column_names = FALSE, row_names_side = &quot;left&quot;, row_names_gp = gpar(fontsize = 8), column_title = &#39;Measles cases in US states 1930-2001\\nVaccine introduced 1961&#39;, top_annotation = ha1, bottom_annotation = ha_column, heatmap_legend_param = list(at = c(0, 5e4, 1e5, 1.5e5), labels = c(&quot;0&quot;, &quot;50k&quot;, &quot;100k&quot;, &quot;150k&quot;))) + ha2 draw(ht_list, ht_gap = unit(3, &quot;mm&quot;)) decorate_heatmap_body(&quot;cases&quot;, { i = which(colnames(mat) == &quot;1961&quot;) x = i/ncol(mat) grid.lines(c(x, x), c(0, 1), gp = gpar(lwd = 2, lty = 2)) grid.text(&quot;Vaccine introduced&quot;, x, unit(1, &quot;npc&quot;) + unit(5, &quot;mm&quot;)) }) 9.3 Visualize Cell Heterogeneity from Single Cell RNASeq In this example, single cell RNA-Seq data for mouse T-cells is visualized to show the heterogeneity of cells. The data (mouse_scRNAseq_corrected.txt) is from Buettner et al., 2015, supplementary data 1, sheet “Cell-cycle corrected gene expr”. You can get mouse_scRNAseq_corrected.txt here. In following code, duplicated genes are removed. expr = read.table(&quot;data/mouse_scRNAseq_corrected.txt&quot;, sep = &quot;\\t&quot;, header = TRUE) expr = expr[!duplicated(expr[[1]]), ] rownames(expr) = expr[[1]] expr = expr[-1] expr = as.matrix(expr) Genes that are not expressed in more than half of the cells are filtered out. expr = expr[apply(expr, 1, function(x) sum(x &gt; 0)/length(x) &gt; 0.5), , drop = FALSE] The get_correlated_variable_rows() function is defined here. It extracts signature genes that are variably expressed between cells and correlate to other genes. get_correlated_variable_genes = function(mat, n = nrow(mat), cor_cutoff = 0, n_cutoff = 0) { ind = order(apply(mat, 1, function(x) { q = quantile(x, c(0.1, 0.9)) x = x[x &lt; q[1] &amp; x &gt; q[2]] var(x)/mean(x) }), decreasing = TRUE)[1:n] mat2 = mat[ind, , drop = FALSE] dt = cor(t(mat2), method = &quot;spearman&quot;) diag(dt) = 0 dt[abs(dt) &lt; cor_cutoff] = 0 dt[dt &lt; 0] = -1 dt[dt &gt; 0] = 1 i = colSums(abs(dt)) &gt; n_cutoff mat3 = mat2[i, ,drop = FALSE] return(mat3) } Signature genes are defined as a list of genes where each gene correlates to more than 20 genes with an absolute correlation larger than 0.5. mat2 contains expression values scaled per gene, which means it contains relative expression across cells for every gene. Since single cell RNASeq data is highly variable and outliers are frequent, gene expression is only scaled within the 10th and 90th quantiles. mat = get_correlated_variable_genes(expr, cor_cutoff = 0.5, n_cutoff = 20) mat2 = t(apply(mat, 1, function(x) { q10 = quantile(x, 0.1) q90 = quantile(x, 0.9) x[x &lt; q10] = q10 x[x &gt; q90] = q90 scale(x) })) colnames(mat2) = colnames(mat) Load cell cycle genes and ribonucleoprotein genes. The cell cycle gene list is from Buettner et al., 2015, supplementary table 1, sheet “Union of Cyclebase and GO genes”. Ribonucleoprotein genes are from GO:0030529. Gene list are stored in mouse_cell_cycle_gene.rds and mouse_ribonucleoprotein.rds. The two files can be found here and here. cc = readRDS(&quot;data/mouse_cell_cycle_gene.rds&quot;) ccl = rownames(mat) %in% cc cc_gene = rownames(mat)[ccl] rp = readRDS(&quot;data/mouse_ribonucleoprotein.rds&quot;) rpl = rownames(mat) %in% rp Since with scaling the expression values per gene the expression level of a gene relative to other genes has been lost, we calculate the base mean as the mean expression of a gene throughout all samples. The base mean can be used to compare expression levels between genes. base_mean = rowMeans(mat) Now the following information is available: scaled expression, mat2, base mean, base_mean, whether genes are ribonucleoprotein genes, rpl, whether genes are cell cycle genes, ccl, symbols for cell cycle genes, cc_gene, In the next step, we can put the information together and visualize it as a list of heatmaps. A gene-gene correlation heatmap is added at the end and defined to be the main_heatmap, meaning that the row order of all heatmaps/row annotations are based on the clustering of this correlation matrix. For cell cycle genes with relatively high expression levels (larger than the 25% quantile of all genes), the gene name is indicated as text labels. In the first heatmap, the column dendrogram is underlaid with two different colours based in the two main groups derived by hierarchical clustering to highlight the two subpopulations. library(GetoptLong) ht_list = Heatmap(mat2, col = colorRamp2(c(-1.5, 0, 1.5), c(&quot;blue&quot;, &quot;white&quot;, &quot;red&quot;)), name = &quot;scaled_expr&quot;, column_title = qq(&quot;relative expression for @{nrow(mat)} genes&quot;), show_column_names = FALSE, width = unit(8, &quot;cm&quot;), heatmap_legend_param = list(title = &quot;Scaled expr&quot;)) + Heatmap(base_mean, name = &quot;base_expr&quot;, width = unit(5, &quot;mm&quot;), heatmap_legend_param = list(title = &quot;Base expr&quot;)) + Heatmap(rpl + 0, name = &quot;ribonucleoprotein&quot;, col = c(&quot;0&quot; = &quot;white&quot;, &quot;1&quot; = &quot;purple&quot;), show_heatmap_legend = FALSE, width = unit(5, &quot;mm&quot;)) + Heatmap(ccl + 0, name = &quot;cell_cycle&quot;, col = c(&quot;0&quot; = &quot;white&quot;, &quot;1&quot; = &quot;red&quot;), show_heatmap_legend = FALSE, width = unit(5, &quot;mm&quot;)) + rowAnnotation(link = anno_mark(at = which(ccl &amp; base_mean &gt; quantile(base_mean, 0.25)), labels = rownames(mat)[ccl &amp; base_mean &gt; quantile(base_mean, 0.25)], labels_gp = gpar(fontsize = 10), padding = unit(1, &quot;mm&quot;))) + Heatmap(cor(t(mat2)), name = &quot;cor&quot;, col = colorRamp2(c(-1, 0, 1), c(&quot;green&quot;, &quot;white&quot;, &quot;red&quot;)), show_row_names = FALSE, show_column_names = FALSE, row_dend_side = &quot;right&quot;, show_column_dend = FALSE, column_title = &quot;pairwise correlation between genes&quot;, heatmap_legend_param = list(title = &quot;Correlation&quot;)) ht_list = draw(ht_list, main_heatmap = &quot;cor&quot;) decorate_column_dend(&quot;scaled_expr&quot;, { tree = column_dend(ht_list)$scaled_expr ind = cutree(as.hclust(tree), k = 2)[order.dendrogram(tree)] first_index = function(l) which(l)[1] last_index = function(l) { x = which(l); x[length(x)] } x1 = c(first_index(ind == 1), first_index(ind == 2)) - 1 x2 = c(last_index(ind == 1), last_index(ind == 2)) grid.rect(x = x1/length(ind), width = (x2 - x1)/length(ind), just = &quot;left&quot;, default.units = &quot;npc&quot;, gp = gpar(fill = c(&quot;#FF000040&quot;, &quot;#00FF0040&quot;), col = NA)) }) The heatmap clearly reveals that the cells are separated into two sub-populations. The population on the left in the first heatmap exhibits high expression of a subset of cell cycle genes (cell cycle genes are indicated in “cell_cycle” heatmap). However, the overall expression level for these genes is relatively low (see “base_expr” heatmap). The population on the right has higher expression in the other signature genes. Interestingly, the signature genes which are higher expressed in this subpopulation are enriched for genes coding for ribonucleoproteins (see “ribonucleoprotein” heatmap). A subset of the ribonucleoprotein genes shows strong coexpression (see correlation heatmap) and overall high expression levels (“base_expr” heatmap). 9.4 Correlations between methylation, expression and other genomic features In the following example, data is randomly generated based on patterns found in an unpublished analysis. First we load the data. meth.rds can be found here. res_list = readRDS(&quot;data/meth.rds&quot;) type = res_list$type mat_meth = res_list$mat_meth mat_expr = res_list$mat_expr direction = res_list$direction cor_pvalue = res_list$cor_pvalue gene_type = res_list$gene_type anno_gene = res_list$anno_gene dist = res_list$dist anno_enhancer = res_list$anno_enhancer The different sources of information and corresponding variables are: type: the label which shows whether the sample is tumor or normal. mat_meth: a matrix in which rows correspond to differetially methylated regions (DMRs). The value in the matrix is the mean methylation level in the DMR in every sample. mat_expr: a matrix in which rows correspond to genes which are associated to the DMRs (i.e. the nearest gene to the DMR). The value in the matrix is the expression level for each gene in each sample. Expression is scaled for every gene across samples. direction: direction of the methylation change (hyper meaning higher methylation in tumor samples, hypo means lower methylation in tumor samples). cor_pvalue: p-value for the correlation test between methylation and expression of the associated gene. gene_type: type of the genes (e.g. protein coding genes or lincRNAs). anno_gene: annotation to the gene models (intergenic, intragenic or TSS). dist: distance from DMRs to TSS of the assiciated genes. anno_enhancer: fraction of the DMR that overlaps enhancers. The data only includes DMRs for which methylation and expression of the associated gene are negatively correlated. The clustering of columns for the methylation matrix are calculated first so that columns in the expression matrix can be adjusted to have the same column order as in the methylation matrix. column_tree = hclust(dist(t(mat_meth))) column_order = column_tree$order library(RColorBrewer) meth_col_fun = colorRamp2(c(0, 0.5, 1), c(&quot;blue&quot;, &quot;white&quot;, &quot;red&quot;)) direction_col = c(&quot;hyper&quot; = &quot;red&quot;, &quot;hypo&quot; = &quot;blue&quot;) expr_col_fun = colorRamp2(c(-2, 0, 2), c(&quot;green&quot;, &quot;white&quot;, &quot;red&quot;)) pvalue_col_fun = colorRamp2(c(0, 2, 4), c(&quot;white&quot;, &quot;white&quot;, &quot;red&quot;)) gene_type_col = structure(brewer.pal(length(unique(gene_type)), &quot;Set3&quot;), names = unique(gene_type)) anno_gene_col = structure(brewer.pal(length(unique(anno_gene)), &quot;Set1&quot;), names = unique(anno_gene)) dist_col_fun = colorRamp2(c(0, 10000), c(&quot;black&quot;, &quot;white&quot;)) enhancer_col_fun = colorRamp2(c(0, 1), c(&quot;white&quot;, &quot;orange&quot;)) We first define two column annotations and then make the complex heatmaps. ht_opt( legend_title_gp = gpar(fontsize = 8, fontface = &quot;bold&quot;), legend_labels_gp = gpar(fontsize = 8), heatmap_column_names_gp = gpar(fontsize = 8), heatmap_column_title_gp = gpar(fontsize = 10), heatmap_row_title_gp = gpar(fontsize = 8) ) ha = HeatmapAnnotation(type = type, col = list(type = c(&quot;Tumor&quot; = &quot;pink&quot;, &quot;Control&quot; = &quot;royalblue&quot;)), annotation_name_side = &quot;left&quot;) ha2 = HeatmapAnnotation(type = type, col = list(type = c(&quot;Tumor&quot; = &quot;pink&quot;, &quot;Control&quot; = &quot;royalblue&quot;)), show_legend = FALSE) ht_list = Heatmap(mat_meth, name = &quot;methylation&quot;, col = meth_col_fun, column_order= column_order, top_annotation = ha, column_title = &quot;Methylation&quot;) + Heatmap(direction, name = &quot;direction&quot;, col = direction_col) + Heatmap(mat_expr[, column_tree$order], name = &quot;expression&quot;, col = expr_col_fun, column_order = column_order, top_annotation = ha2, column_title = &quot;Expression&quot;) + Heatmap(cor_pvalue, name = &quot;-log10(cor_p)&quot;, col = pvalue_col_fun) + Heatmap(gene_type, name = &quot;gene type&quot;, col = gene_type_col) + Heatmap(anno_gene, name = &quot;anno_gene&quot;, col = anno_gene_col) + Heatmap(dist, name = &quot;dist_tss&quot;, col = dist_col_fun) + Heatmap(anno_enhancer, name = &quot;anno_enhancer&quot;, col = enhancer_col_fun, cluster_columns = FALSE, column_title = &quot;Enhancer&quot;) draw(ht_list, row_km = 2, row_split = direction, column_title = &quot;Comprehensive correspondence between methylation, expression and other genomic features&quot;, column_title_gp = gpar(fontsize = 12, fontface = &quot;bold&quot;), merge_legends = TRUE, heatmap_legend_side = &quot;bottom&quot;) ht_opt(RESET = TRUE) The complex heatmaps reveal that highly methylated DMRs are enriched in intergenic and intragenic regions and rarely overlap with enhancers. In contrast, lowly methylated DMRs are enriched for transcription start sites (TSS) and enhancers. 9.5 Visualize Methylation Profile with Complex Annotations In this example, Figure 1 in Strum et al., 2012 is re-implemented with some adjustments. Some packages need to be loaded firstly. library(matrixStats) library(GenomicRanges) Methylation profiles can be download from GEO database. The GEOquery package is used to retrieve data from GEO. library(GEOquery) gset = getGEO(&quot;GSE36278&quot;) The methylation profiles have been measured by Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip arrays. We load probe data via the IlluminaHumanMethylation450kanno.ilmn12.hg19 package. Adjust row names in the matrix to be the same as the probes. library(IlluminaHumanMethylation450kanno.ilmn12.hg19) data(Locations) mat = exprs(gset[[1]]) colnames(mat) = phenoData(gset[[1]])@data$title mat = mat[rownames(Locations), ] probe contains locations of probes and also information whether the CpG sites overlap with SNPs. Here we remove probes that are on sex chromosomes and probes that overlap with SNPs. data(SNPs.137CommonSingle) data(Islands.UCSC) l = Locations$chr %in% paste0(&quot;chr&quot;, 1:22) &amp; is.na(SNPs.137CommonSingle$Probe_rs) mat = mat[l, ] Get subsets for locations of probes and the annotation to CpG Islands accordingly. cgi = Islands.UCSC$Relation_to_Island[l] loc = Locations[l, ] Separate the matrix into a matrix for tumor samples and a matrix for normal samples. Also modify column names for the tumor samples to be consistent with the phenotype data which we will read later. mat1 = as.matrix(mat[, grep(&quot;GBM&quot;, colnames(mat))]) # tumor samples mat2 = as.matrix(mat[, grep(&quot;CTRL&quot;, colnames(mat))]) # normal samples colnames(mat1) = gsub(&quot;GBM&quot;, &quot;dkfz&quot;, colnames(mat1)) Phenotype data is from Sturm et al., 2012, supplementary table S1 and can be found here. The rows of phenotype data are adjusted to be the same as the columns of the methylation matrix. phenotype = read.table(&quot;data/450K_annotation.txt&quot;, header = TRUE, sep = &quot;\\t&quot;, row.names = 1, check.names = FALSE, comment.char = &quot;&quot;, stringsAsFactors = FALSE) phenotype = phenotype[colnames(mat1), ] Please note that we only use the 136 samples which are from DKFZ, while in Sturm et al., 2012, additional 74 TCGA samples have been used. Extract the top 8000 probes with most variable methylation in the tumor samples, and also subset other information correspondingly. ind = order(rowVars(mat1, na.rm = TRUE), decreasing = TRUE)[1:8000] m1 = mat1[ind, ] m2 = mat2[ind, ] cgi2 = cgi[ind] cgi2 = ifelse(grepl(&quot;Shore&quot;, cgi2), &quot;Shore&quot;, cgi2) cgi2 = ifelse(grepl(&quot;Shelf&quot;, cgi2), &quot;Shelf&quot;, cgi2) loc = loc[ind, ] For each probe, find the distance to the closest TSS. pc_tx_tss.bed contains positions of TSS from protein coding genes. gr = GRanges(loc[, 1], ranges = IRanges(loc[, 2], loc[, 2]+1)) tss = read.table(&quot;data/pc_tx_tss.bed&quot;, stringsAsFactors = FALSE) tss = GRanges(tss[[1]], ranges = IRanges(tss[, 2], tss[, 3])) tss_dist = distanceToNearest(gr, tss) tss_dist = tss_dist@elementMetadata$distance Because there are a few NA in the matrix (sum(is.na(m1))/length(m1) = 0.0011967) which will break the cor() function, we replace NA to the intermediate methylation (0.5). Note that although ComplexHeatmap allows NA in the matrix, removal of NA will speed up the clustering. m1[is.na(m1)] = 0.5 m2[is.na(m2)] = 0.5 The following annotations will be added to the columns of the methylation matrix: age subtype classification by DKFZ subtype classification by TCGA subtype classification by TCGA, based on expression profile IDH1 mutation H3F3A mutation TP53 mutation chr7 gain chr10 loss CDKN2A deletion EGFR amplification PDGFRA amplification In following code we define the column annotation in the ha variable. Also we customize colors, legends and height of the annotations. mutation_col = structure(names = c(&quot;MUT&quot;, &quot;WT&quot;, &quot;G34R&quot;, &quot;G34V&quot;, &quot;K27M&quot;), c(&quot;black&quot;, &quot;white&quot;, &quot;#4DAF4A&quot;, &quot;#4DAF4A&quot;, &quot;#377EB8&quot;)) cnv_col = c(&quot;gain&quot; = &quot;#E41A1C&quot;, &quot;loss&quot; = &quot;#377EB8&quot;, &quot;amp&quot; = &quot;#E41A1C&quot;, &quot;del&quot; = &quot;#377EB8&quot;, &quot;normal&quot; = &quot;white&quot;) ha = HeatmapAnnotation( age = anno_points(phenotype[[13]], gp = gpar(col = ifelse(phenotype[[13]] &gt; 20, &quot;black&quot;, &quot;red&quot;)), height = unit(3, &quot;cm&quot;)), dkfz_cluster = phenotype[[1]], tcga_cluster = phenotype[[2]], tcga_expr = phenotype[[3]], IDH1 = phenotype[[5]], H3F3A = phenotype[[4]], TP53 = phenotype[[6]], chr7_gain = ifelse(phenotype[[7]] == 1, &quot;gain&quot;, &quot;normal&quot;), chr10_loss = ifelse(phenotype[[8]] == 1, &quot;loss&quot;, &quot;normal&quot;), CDKN2A_del = ifelse(phenotype[[9]] == 1, &quot;del&quot;, &quot;normal&quot;), EGFR_amp = ifelse(phenotype[[10]] == 1, &quot;amp&quot;, &quot;normal&quot;), PDGFRA_amp = ifelse(phenotype[[11]] == 1, &quot;amp&quot;, &quot;normal&quot;), col = list(dkfz_cluster = structure(names = c(&quot;IDH&quot;, &quot;K27&quot;, &quot;G34&quot;, &quot;RTK I PDGFRA&quot;, &quot;Mesenchymal&quot;, &quot;RTK II Classic&quot;), brewer.pal(6, &quot;Set1&quot;)), tcga_cluster = structure(names = c(&quot;G-CIMP+&quot;, &quot;Cluster #2&quot;, &quot;Cluster #3&quot;), brewer.pal(3, &quot;Set1&quot;)), tcga_expr = structure(names = c(&quot;Proneural&quot;, &quot;Classical&quot;, &quot;Mesenchymal&quot;), c(&quot;#377EB8&quot;, &quot;#FFFF33&quot;, &quot;#FF7F00&quot;)), IDH1 = mutation_col, H3F3A = mutation_col, TP53 = mutation_col, chr7_gain = cnv_col, chr10_loss = cnv_col, CDKN2A_del = cnv_col, EGFR_amp = cnv_col, PDGFRA_amp = cnv_col), na_col = &quot;grey&quot;, border = TRUE, show_legend = c(TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE), show_annotation_name = FALSE, annotation_legend_param = list( dkfz_cluster = list(title = &quot;DKFZ Methylation&quot;), tcga_cluster = list(title = &quot;TCGA Methylation&quot;), tcga_expr = list(title = &quot;TCGA Expression&quot;), H3F3A = list(title = &quot;Mutations&quot;), chr7_gain = list(title = &quot;CNV&quot;)) ) In the final plot, there are four heatmaps added. From left to right, there are heatmap for methylation in tumor samples methylation in normal samples distance to nearest TSS CpG Island (CGI) annotation.

When multiple heatmaps are concatenated, or the groups for columns have already been defined, for each row, we want to compare between heatmaps or column groups, thus, multiple boxplots need to be drawn for each single row. In following example, we demonstrate how to implement an annotation function which draws multiple boxplots for single rows. The grid.boxplot() function is from ComplexHeatmap package which makes it easy to draw boxplot under grid system. m1 = matrix(sort(rnorm(100)), 10, byrow = TRUE) m2 = matrix(sort(rnorm(100), decreasing = TRUE), 10, byrow = TRUE) nr = nrow(m1) ht_list = Heatmap(m1, name = &quot;m1&quot;) + Heatmap(m2, name = &quot;m2&quot;) rg = range(c(m1, m2)) rg[1] = rg[1] - (rg[2] - rg[1])* 0.02 rg[2] = rg[2] + (rg[2] - rg[1])* 0.02 anno_multiple_boxplot = function(index) { pushViewport(viewport(xscale = rg, yscale = c(0.5, nr + 0.5))) for(i in seq_along(index)) { grid.rect(y = nr-i+1, height = 1, default.units = &quot;native&quot;) grid.boxplot(m1[ index[i], ], pos = nr-i+1 + 0.2, box_width = 0.3, gp = gpar(fill = &quot;red&quot;), direction = &quot;horizontal&quot;) grid.boxplot(m2[ index[i], ], pos = nr-i+1 - 0.2, box_width = 0.3, gp = gpar(fill = &quot;green&quot;), direction = &quot;horizontal&quot;) } grid.xaxis() popViewport() } ht_list = ht_list + rowAnnotation(boxplot = anno_multiple_boxplot, width = unit(4, &quot;cm&quot;), show_annotation_name = FALSE) lgd = Legend(labels = c(&quot;m1&quot;, &quot;m2&quot;), title = &quot;boxplots&quot;, legend_gp = gpar(fill = c(&quot;red&quot;, &quot;green&quot;))) draw(ht_list, padding = unit(c(20, 2, 2, 2), &quot;mm&quot;), heatmap_legend_list = list(lgd)) "],
["other-high-level-plots.html", "Chapter 10 Other High-level Plots 10.1 Density heatmap 10.2 Stacked summary plot", " Chapter 10 Other High-level Plots 10.1 Density heatmap To visualize data distribution in a matrix or in a list, we normally use boxplot or violin plot. We can also use colors to map the density values and visualize distribution through a heatmap. It is useful if you have huge number of columns in data to visualize. In following examples, we use matrix as input data where the density is calculated by columns. The input data can also be a list. set.seed(123) m = cbind(matrix(rnorm(10*100), ncol = 10), matrix(runif(10*100, min = -2, max = 2) + 0.5, ncol = 10)) colnames(m) = paste0(&quot;C&quot;, 1:ncol(m)) densityHeatmap(m) On the heatmap, there are also lines representing five quantiles and mean values. Data range is controlled by ylim. Title is controlled by title or column_title. Title on y-axis is controlled by ylab. densityHeatmap(m, ylim = c(-2, 2), title = &quot;Distribution as heatmap&quot;, ylab = &quot;some values&quot;) Column order is controlled by column_order. densityHeatmap(m, column_order = sample(20, 20)) The color for the density values is controlled by col which is a vector of colors. densityHeatmap(m, col = topo.colors(10)) Internally, the density for all columns are stored as a matrix where rows correspond to the same bins. Since it is a matrix, clustering can be applied on it. There is a special distance method ks for measuring similarity between distributions which is the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic between two distributions (ks distance is the default if cluster_column = TRUE). densityHeatmap(m, cluster_columns = TRUE, clustering_distance_columns = &quot;ks&quot;) When there are many distributions to calculate the pairwise Kolmogorov-Smirnov distance, mc.cores argument can be set to make it running parallelly. densityHeatmap(m, cluster_columns = TRUE, mc.cores = ...) Column annotations can be added as top annotation or bottom annotation. ha1 = HeatmapAnnotation(dist = c(rep(&quot;rnorm&quot;, 10), rep(&quot;runif&quot;, 10))) ha2 = HeatmapAnnotation(foo = anno_points(rnorm(20))) densityHeatmap(m, top_annotation = ha1, bottom_annotation = ha2) Heatmaps and column annotations can only be concatenated to the density heatmap vertically. densityHeatmap(m) %v% HeatmapAnnotation(foo = anno_barplot(1:20)) %v% Heatmap(matrix(rnorm(20*20), ncol = 20), name = &quot;mat&quot;, height = unit(6, &quot;cm&quot;)) 10.2 Stacked summary plot Multiple annotations and heatmaps can be used to visualize multiple summary statistics for a same set of features. In following example, there are multiple statistics for differential methylated regions (DMRs) from four different subgroups. lt = readRDS(system.file(&quot;extdata&quot;, package = &quot;ComplexHeatmap&quot;, &quot;dmr_summary.rds&quot;)) names(lt) ## [1] &quot;label&quot; &quot;mean_meth&quot; &quot;n_gr&quot; &quot;n_corr&quot; ## [5] &quot;dist_tss&quot; &quot;gene_anno&quot; &quot;cgi_anno&quot; &quot;mat_enrich_gf&quot; ## [9] &quot;mat_pct_st&quot; &quot;mat_enrich_st&quot; These statistics for DMRs are: label: The labels for the sets of DMRs. There are DMRs for four subgroups and for each subgroup, DMRs are separated into hyper-methylated DMRs and hypo-methylated DMRs. mean_meth: The mean methylation in DMRs in tumor samples and in normal samples. n_gr Number of DMRs in each set. n_corr: Percent of DMRs that show significant correlation to nearby genes. The positive correlation and negative correlation are calculated separatedly. dist_tss: Distance to nearby gene TSS. The value is proportion of DMRs in current set which have distance less in 1kb, between 1kb and 5kb, between 5kb and 10kb and more than 10kb. gene_anno: The proportion of DMRs that overlap to genes or intergenic regions. cgi_anno: The proportion of DMRs that overlap to CpG islands or CGI shores. mat_enrich_gf: The enrichment to a list of genomic features. Positive values mean over representation. mat_pct_st: The proprotion of DMRs that overlap to chromatin states. mat_enrich_st: The enrichment to the chromatin states. Attach all these variables to the working environment. attach(lt) Since we have many statistics to visualize, we first define the colors. We define color mapping functions for the statistics which we want to visualize as heatmaps and color vectors for those we want to visualize as barplots. library(circlize) meth_col_fun = colorRamp2(c(0, 0.5, 1), c(&quot;blue&quot;, &quot;white&quot;, &quot;red&quot;)) corr_col = c(&quot;green&quot;, &quot;red&quot;) dist_tss_col = c(&quot;#FF0000&quot;, &quot;#FF7352&quot;, &quot;#FFB299&quot;, &quot;#FFD9CB&quot;) gene_anno_col = c(&quot;green&quot;, &quot;blue&quot;) cgi_anno_col = c(&quot;#FFA500&quot;, &quot;#FFD191&quot;) z_score_col_fun = colorRamp2(c(-200, 0, 200), c(&quot;green&quot;, &quot;white&quot;, &quot;red&quot;)) state_col = c(&quot;#FF0000&quot;, &quot;#008000&quot;, &quot;#C2E105&quot;, &quot;#8A91D0&quot;, &quot;#CD5C5C&quot;, &quot;#808080&quot;, &quot;#000000&quot;) The construction of the heatmap list very straightforward. Each statistic is constructed as a heatmap or a row annotation. anno_width = unit(3, &quot;cm&quot;) ht_list = rowAnnotation(text = anno_text(label, location = unit(1, &quot;npc&quot;), just = &quot;right&quot;, gp = gpar(fontsize = 12))) ht_list = ht_list + Heatmap(mean_meth, name = &quot;mean_meth&quot;, col = meth_col_fun, cluster_rows = FALSE, row_title = NULL, cluster_columns = FALSE, show_row_names = FALSE, heatmap_legend_param = list(title = &quot;Methylation&quot;), width = ncol(mean_meth)*unit(4, &quot;mm&quot;)) + rowAnnotation(&quot;n_gr&quot; = anno_barplot(n_gr, bar_width = 1, width = anno_width), show_annotation_name = FALSE) + rowAnnotation(&quot;n_corr&quot; = anno_barplot(n_corr, bar_width = 1, gp = gpar(fill = corr_col), width = anno_width), show_annotation_name = FALSE) + rowAnnotation(&quot;dist_tss&quot; = anno_barplot(dist_tss, bar_width = 1, gp = gpar(fill = dist_tss_col), width = anno_width), show_annotation_name = FALSE) + rowAnnotation(&quot;gene_anno&quot; = anno_barplot(gene_anno, bar_width = 1, gp = gpar(fill = gene_anno_col), width = anno_width), show_annotation_name = FALSE) + rowAnnotation(&quot;cgi_anno&quot; = anno_barplot(cgi_anno, bar_width = 1, gp = gpar(fill = cgi_anno_col), width = anno_width), show_annotation_name = FALSE) + Heatmap(mat_enrich_gf, name = &quot;enrich_gf&quot;, col = z_score_col_fun, cluster_columns = FALSE, width = unit(ncol(mat_enrich_gf)*4, &quot;mm&quot;), column_title = &quot;&quot;, heatmap_legend_param = list(title = &quot;Z-score&quot;)) + rowAnnotation(&quot;pct_st&quot; = anno_barplot(mat_pct_st, bar_width = 1, gp = gpar(fill = state_col), width = anno_width), show_annotation_name = FALSE) + Heatmap(mat_enrich_st, name = &quot;enrich_st&quot;, col = z_score_col_fun, cluster_columns = FALSE, width = unit(ncol(mat_enrich_st)*6, &quot;mm&quot;), column_title = &quot;&quot;, show_heatmap_legend = FALSE, column_names_gp = gpar(col = state_col), show_row_names = FALSE) Since annotation barplots do not generate legends, we manually construct these legends with Legend() function. lgd_list = list( Legend(labels = c(&quot;gene&quot;, &quot;intergenic&quot;), title = &quot;Gene annotation&quot;, legend_gp = gpar(fill = gene_anno_col)), Legend(labels = c(&quot;&lt;1kb&quot;, &quot;1kb~5kb&quot;, &quot;5kb~10kb&quot;, &quot;&gt;10kb&quot;), title = &quot;Distance to TSS&quot;, legend_gp = gpar(fill = dist_tss_col)), Legend(labels = c(&quot;CGI&quot;, &quot;CGI shore&quot;), title = &quot;CGI annotation&quot;, legend_gp = gpar(fill = cgi_anno_col)), Legend(labels = colnames(mat_enrich_st), title = &quot;Chromatin states&quot;, legend_gp = gpar(fill = state_col)) ) When drawing the heatmap list, the rows of all heatmaps and annotations are split into two major groups. Note in the first Heatmap() which corresponds to the mean methylation matrix, we set row_title = NULL to remove the row titles which is from row splitting. Since later we will add titles for the annotations, we allocate white space on top of the whole plotting region by padding argument. Also we concatenate the self-defined legend list to the heatmap legend list and put them horizontally at the bottom of the heatmap list. draw(ht_list, padding = unit(c(2, 2, 20, 2), &quot;mm&quot;), row_split = gsub(&quot;\\\\d+$&quot;, &quot;&quot;, label), heatmap_legend_list = lgd_list, heatmap_legend_side = &quot;bottom&quot;) anno_title = c(&quot;n_gr&quot; = &quot;Number of\\nDMRs&quot;, &quot;n_corr&quot; = &quot;Significantly\\ncorrelated genes&quot;, &quot;gene_anno&quot; = &quot;Gene annotation&quot;, &quot;dist_tss&quot; = &quot;Distance to TSS&quot;, &quot;cgi_anno&quot; = &quot;CGI annotation&quot;, &quot;pct_st&quot; = &quot;Overlap to\\nChromatin states&quot;) for(an in names(anno_title)) { decorate_annotation(an, { grid.text(anno_title[an], y = unit(1, &quot;npc&quot;) + unit(3, &quot;mm&quot;), just = &quot;bottom&quot;) }) } ht_title = c(&quot;mean_meth&quot; = &quot;Mean\\nmethylation&quot;, &quot;enrich_gf&quot; = &quot;Enrichment to\\ngenomic features&quot;, &quot;enrich_st&quot; = &quot;Enrichment to\\nchromatin states&quot;) for(an in names(ht_title)) { decorate_heatmap_body(an, { grid.text(ht_title[an], y = unit(1, &quot;npc&quot;) + unit(3, &quot;mm&quot;), just = &quot;bottom&quot;) }) } Similarlly, the multiple statistics can also be arranged vertically. In following example, we visualize several statistics for a list of genomic regions in 40 samples, from four subgroups. The statistics are: prop: The proportion in the genome. median_length: The median length of regions in each sample. group: subgroup labels. prop = c( runif(10, min = 0.1, max = 0.5), runif(10, min = 0.2, max = 0.4), runif(10, min = 0.3, max = 0.6), runif(10, min = 0.4, max = 0.8) ) median_length = c( runif(10, min = 5000, max = 10000), runif(10, min = 6000, max = 20000), runif(10, min = 7000, max = 15000), runif(10, min = 6000, max = 30000) ) group = rep(letters[1:4], each = 10) Note in following example, there is no heatmap in the list. ht_list = HeatmapAnnotation(prop = anno_barplot(prop, height = unit(4, &quot;cm&quot;), axis_param = list(at = c(0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8), labels = c(&quot;0%&quot;, &quot;20%&quot;, &quot;40%&quot;, &quot;60%&quot;, &quot;80%&quot;))), annotation_name_rot = 90) %v% HeatmapAnnotation(median_length = anno_barplot(median_length, height = unit(4, &quot;cm&quot;), axis_param = list(at = c(0, 10000, 20000), labels = c(&quot;0kb&quot;, &quot;10kb&quot;, &quot;20kb&quot;))), annotation_name_rot = 90) %v% HeatmapAnnotation(group = group) draw(ht_list, column_title = &quot;Statistics for a list of genomic regions&quot;) For concatenation of multiple annotations, individual annotations can also be put into one single HeatmapAnnotation(). E.g. previous code is almost exactly the same as following code: # code only for demonstration HeatmapAnnotation( prop = anno_barplot(prop, height = unit(4, &quot;cm&quot;), axis_param = list(at = c(0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8), labels = c(&quot;0%&quot;, &quot;20%&quot;, &quot;40%&quot;, &quot;60%&quot;, &quot;80%&quot;))), median_length = anno_barplot(median_length, height = unit(4, &quot;cm&quot;), axis_param = list(at = c(0, 10000, 20000), labels = c(&quot;0kb&quot;, &quot;10kb&quot;, &quot;20kb&quot;))), group = group, annotation_name_rot = c(90, 90, 0), gap = unit(2, &quot;mm&quot;) ) %v% NULL # add NULL to convert single HeatmapAnnotation to HeatmapList "],
["other-tricks.html", "Chapter 11 Other Tricks 11.1 Set the same cell size for different heatmaps with different dimensions 11.2 Integrate with gridtext package", " Chapter 11 Other Tricks 11.1 Set the same cell size for different heatmaps with different dimensions Assume you have a list of heatmaps/oncoPrints that you want to save as different e.g. png or pdf files, one thing you might want to do is to make the size of each grid/cell in the heatmap identical across heatmaps, thus, you need to calculate the size of png/pdf file according to the number of rows or columns in the heatmap. In the heatmap generated by ComplexHeatmap, all the heatmap components have absolute size and only the size of the heatmap body (or the size of the cells) is changable (or in other words, if you change the size of the final graphic device, e.g. by draging the graphics window if you plot in, only the size of the heatmap body is adjusted), which means, the size of the whole plot is linearly related to the number of rows or columns in the heatmap. This implies we can actually fit a linear model y = a*x + b where e.g. y is the height of the whole plot and x is the number of rows. In following example, we simply demonstrate how to establish the relation between the plot height and the number of rows in the heatmap. We first define a function which generates a 10-column matrix with specific number of rows. Note the values in the matrix is of no importance in this demonstration. random_mat = function(nr) { m = matrix(rnorm(10*nr), nc = 10) colnames(m) = letters[1:10] return(m) } Since the relation is absolutely linear, we only need to test two heatmaps with different number of rows where the height of a single row is unit(5, \"mm\"). In the heatmap, there are also column title, column dendrogram, column annotation and the column names. There are several things that needs to be noted in following code: The heatmap object should be returned by draw() because the layout of the heatmap is calculated only after the execution of draw(). component_height() returns a vector of units which correspond to the height of all heatmap components from top to bottom in the heatmap. (component_width() returns the width of heatmap components). When calculating ht_height, we add unit(4, \"mm\") because on top and bottom of the final plot, there are 2mm white borders. ht_height needs to be converted to a simple unit in cm or inch. In following, y contains values which are measured in inch unit. y = NULL for(nr in c(10, 20)) { ht = draw(Heatmap(random_mat(nr), height = unit(5, &quot;mm&quot;)*nr, column_title = &quot;foo&quot;, # one line text top_annotation = HeatmapAnnotation(bar = 1:10))) ht_height = sum(component_height(ht)) + unit(4, &quot;mm&quot;) ht_height = convertHeight(ht_height, &quot;inch&quot;, valueOnly = TRUE) y = c(y, ht_height) } Then we can fit a linear relation between y and the number of rows: x = c(10, 20) lm(y ~ x) ## ## Call: ## lm(formula = y ~ x) ## ## Coefficients: ## (Intercept) x ## 1.3150 0.1969 This means the relation between the number of rows x and the height of the plot y is: y = 0.1969*x + 1.3150. You can test whether the height of single rows are the same for heatmaps with different rows by following code. Note all the heatmap configuations should be the same as the ones you prepare y. for(nr in c(10, 20)) { png(paste0(&quot;test_heatmap_nr_&quot;, nr, &quot;.png&quot;), width = 5, height = 0.1969*nr + 1.3150, units = &quot;in&quot;, res = 100) draw(Heatmap(random_mat(nr), height = unit(5, &quot;mm&quot;)*nr, column_title = &quot;foo&quot;, # column title can be any one-line string top_annotation = HeatmapAnnotation(bar = 1:10))) dev.off() } 11.2 Integrate with gridtext package The gridtext package provides a nice and easy way for rendering text under the grid system. From version 2.3.3 of ComplexHeatmap, text-related elements can be rendered by gridtext. For all text-related elements, the text needs to be wrapped by gt_render() function, which marks the text and adds related parameters that are going to be processed by gridtext. Currently ComplexHeatmap supports gridtext::richtext_grob(), so some of the parameters for richtext_grob() can be passed via gt_render(). gt_render(&quot;foo&quot;, r = unit(2, &quot;pt&quot;), padding = unit(c(2, 2, 2, 2), &quot;pt&quot;)) ## [1] &quot;foo&quot; ## attr(,&quot;class&quot;) ## [1] &quot;gridtext&quot; ## attr(,&quot;param&quot;) ## attr(,&quot;param&quot;)$r ## [1] 2points ## ## attr(,&quot;param&quot;)$padding ## [1] 2points 2points 2points 2points For each heatmap element, e.g. column title, graphic parameters can be set by the companion argument, e.g. column_title_gp. To make it simpler, all graphic parameters set by box_gp are merged with *_gp by adding box_ prefix, e.g.: ..., column_title = gt_render(&quot;foo&quot;), column_title_gp = gpar(col = &quot;red&quot;, box_fill = &quot;blue&quot;), ... Graphic parameters can also be specified inside gt_render(). Following is the same as the one above: ..., column_title = gt_render(&quot;foo&quot;, gp = gpar(col = &quot;red&quot;, box_fill = &quot;blue&quot;)), ... 11.2.1 Titles set.seed(123) mat = matrix(rnorm(100), 10) rownames(mat) = letters[1:10] Heatmap(mat, column_title = gt_render(&quot;Some &lt;span style=&#39;color:blue&#39;&gt;blue text **in bold.**&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;And *italics text.*&lt;br&gt;And some &lt;span style=&#39;font-size:18pt; color:black&#39;&gt;large&lt;/span&gt; text.&quot;, r = unit(2, &quot;pt&quot;), padding = unit(c(2, 2, 2, 2), &quot;pt&quot;)), column_title_gp = gpar(box_fill = &quot;orange&quot;)) If heatmap is split: Heatmap(mat, row_km = 2, row_title = gt_render(c(&quot;**title1**&quot;, &quot;_title2_&quot;)), row_title_gp = gpar(box_fill = c(&quot;yellow&quot;, &quot;blue&quot;))) 11.2.2 Row/column names Rendered row/column names should be explicitly specified by row_labels/column_labels Heatmap(mat, row_labels = gt_render(letters[1:10], padding = unit(c(2, 10, 2, 10), &quot;pt&quot;)), row_names_gp = gpar(box_col = rep(c(&quot;red&quot;, &quot;green&quot;), times = 5))) 11.2.3 Annotation labels annotation_label argument should be as rendered text. ha = HeatmapAnnotation(foo = letters[1:10], annotation_label = gt_render(&quot;**Annotation** _one_&quot;, gp = gpar(box_col = &quot;black&quot;)), show_legend = FALSE) Heatmap(mat, top_annotation = ha) 11.2.4 Text annotation rowAnnotation( foo = anno_text(gt_render(sapply(LETTERS[1:10], strrep, 10), align_widths = TRUE), gp = gpar(box_col = &quot;blue&quot;, box_lwd = 2), just = &quot;right&quot;, location = unit(1, &quot;npc&quot;) )) + Heatmap(mat) 11.2.5 Legend Heatmap(mat, heatmap_legend_param = list( title = gt_render(&quot;&lt;span style=&#39;color:orange&#39;&gt;**Legend title**&lt;/span&gt;&quot;), title_gp = gpar(box_fill = &quot;grey&quot;), at = c(-3, 0, 3), labels = gt_render(c(&quot;*negative* three&quot;, &quot;zero&quot;, &quot;*positive* three&quot;)) )) "]
